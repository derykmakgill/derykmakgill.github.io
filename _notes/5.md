Watching the Apollo 11 documentary as I work today. Available on [Hulu.](https://www.hulu.com/movie/apollo-11-8d0f469b-c184-488e-aff7-3bd206d94a14)

Recommended reading to go along with it is Rand's incredible [essay](https://newideal.aynrand.org/ayn-rand-on-apollo-11/) on the launch.

>What we had seen, in naked essentials — but in reality, not in a work of art — was the concretized abstraction of man’s greatness. . . .
>
>One knew that this spectacle was not the product of inanimate nature, like some aurora borealis, or of chance, or of luck, that it was unmistakably human — with “human,” for once, meaning grandeur — that a purpose and a long, sustained, disciplined effort had gone to achieve this series of moments, and that man was succeeding, succeeding, succeeding! For once, if only for seven minutes, the worst among those who saw it had to feel — not “How small is man by the side of the Grand Canyon!” — but “How great is man and how safe is nature when he conquers it!”
>
>That we had seen a demonstration of man at his best, no one could doubt — this was the cause of the event’s attraction and of the stunned, numbed state in which it left us. And no one could doubt that we had seen an achievement of man in his capacity as a rational being — an achievement of reason, of logic, of mathematics, of total dedication to the absolutism of reality.
