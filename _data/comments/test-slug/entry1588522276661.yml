message: "I think parents do what they can. Firstly, I'm sure you'd agree you have the luxury of spending this kind of time with your son. Most parents don't. I'm not a parent, but I see my 30/40-something friends run ragged due to requiring a double income just to get by. Parenting ain't what it used to be. Secondly, I would have commended you on your incredible patience but, as it turns out, you enjoy the time you spend with your son as much as he does, which is great! In both cases, you're very lucky. In any case, it sounds like you're an awesome dad, and I have no doubt your son is going to be an amazing person thanks to the foundations you've laid and, well, just good genes. \U0001F609 You rock."
