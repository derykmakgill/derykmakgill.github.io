This is a long, working document that is nowhere near complete.

#### 29 Oct 1995

In a discussion about Digicash on the Cypherpunk Mailing List, 
James A. Donald [critisizes](http://mailing-list-archive.cryptoanarchy.wiki/archive/1995/10/cedf031887bdce1f992b8382dc4c27486c61a68bebd117b9bf2818fa2d6dbe23/) 
the early electronic cash for having high fees.

>While Chaum is a brilliant cryptographer, he is an incompetent businessman
>
>He has demonstrated this in numerous ways.
>
>The latest being "Cash" where the bank skims off 4% to 10% every time.
>
>No one is going to use digicash under these kinds of terms and 
conditions.

Creator of the Cypherpunk Mailing List Timothy C. May [responds](http://mailing-list-archive.cryptoanarchy.wiki/archive/1995/10/cedf031887bdce1f992b8382dc4c27486c61a68bebd117b9bf2818fa2d6dbe23/) 
in agreement.

>I don't know if the "skims off 4% to 10% every time" point accurately
describes how the current Digicash model works, but certainly this will not
fly as a long term rate. So many monetary transactions happen in the course
of business that even a 4% fee _per transaction_ would rapidly wipe out
most of the value.

#### 02 May 1997

Blockstream founder and Hashcash inventor Adam Back [writes](http://mailing-list-archive.cryptoanarchy.wiki/archive/1997/05/ef17e389556d2b6e27e8e0036a85ce1fedc73e2de871cc30728e7fc8be3d7f09/) 
on the Cypherpunk Mailing List that a successful digital cash project must be ultra low cost to transact with.

>What we want is fully anonymous, *ultra low transaction cost,* transferable units of exchange.  If we get that going the banks will become the obsolete dinasaurs they deserve to become.

r/bitcoin owner Atlas is [accused](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=30211.0) of trying to sell r/bitcoin. In the ensuing drama, someone contacts Reddit and he is removed. Theymos becomes the moderator.

#### 11 Sept 2017

Bitcoin Core developer Matt Corallo submits a [filing](https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-nysearca-2017-06/nysearca201706-161046.htm) to the Securities and Exchange Commission to ask them to step in and protect consumers from attempts to create a new Bitcoin.

>I am Matt Corallo, a long-time developer of Bitcoin (around the 10th publicly recorded individual to contribute to the Bitcoin codebase), an expert on Bitcoin's operation, vocal Bitcoin advocate, and strong proponent of the availability of a Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Product (ETP).
>
>I have very grave concerns with the proposed rules for the maintaining of Bitcoin deposits and the lack of consumer protection in the event of Bitcoin Network rule changes in the current filings.
>
>As described in the S-1 filing for the "Bitcoin Investment Trust" (BIT), a "permanent fork" of Bitcoin may occur when two groups of users disagree as to the rules which define the system (its "consensus rules"). More specifically, such a "permanent fork" is likely to occur when one group of users wish to make a change to Bitcoin's consensus rules, while another group does not. This leads to two cryptocurrencies, and may lead to significant ambiguity around which should be referred to as "Bitcoin".
