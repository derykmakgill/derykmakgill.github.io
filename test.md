title: The Great Bitcoin Scaling Debate — An Annotated Timeline
---

This is a long, working document that is nowhere near complete. I attempt to show through a chronology of primary source material that Bitcoin was systematically hijacked and directed against its original vision of scaling on-chain. 

I do not claim that scaling on-chain is the proper way to scale Bitcoin, only that it was the way *intended* by Satoshi Nakamoto and early Bitcoiners, and that technical and economic arguments against scaling on-chain played a less important role in the eventual outcome than censorship, propaganda, etc.

#### 29 October 1995

In a discussion about Digicash on the Cypherpunk Mailing List, 
James A. Donald [critisizes](http://mailing-list-archive.cryptoanarchy.wiki/archive/1995/10/cedf031887bdce1f992b8382dc4c27486c61a68bebd117b9bf2818fa2d6dbe23/) 
the early electronic cash for having high fees.

>While Chaum is a brilliant cryptographer, he is an incompetent businessman
>
>He has demonstrated this in numerous ways.
>
>The latest being "Cash" where the bank skims off 4% to 10% every time.
>
>No one is going to use digicash under these kinds of terms and 
conditions.

#### 30 Oct 1995

Creator of the Cypherpunk Mailing List Timothy C. May [responds](http://mailing-list-archive.cryptoanarchy.wiki/archive/1995/10/cedf031887bdce1f992b8382dc4c27486c61a68bebd117b9bf2818fa2d6dbe23/) 
in agreement.

>I don't know if the "skims off 4% to 10% every time" point accurately
describes how the current Digicash model works, but certainly this will not
fly as a long term rate. So many monetary transactions happen in the course
of business that even a 4% fee _per transaction_ would rapidly wipe out
most of the value.

#### 14 June 1996

Hal Finney argues for the [utility of online micropayments](http://mailing-list-archive.cryptoanarchy.wiki/archive/1996/06/b2345507ef1258011af9ea463ae9b03714f5cd29c4092458bd0002b360f1d545/) on the Cypherpunk Mailing List.

>Consider two sites, one which acts as a proxy and cache but which
charges something under a penny per page, and another which acts for
free.  Won't the for-pay site be able to afford a larger disk, more
servers, and better net connections?  It will be a superior service.
>
>Micropayments will allow new services and improved quality over what we
have today where we have to rely on charity and advertising as
motivations for much of what we find on the web.

#### 02 May 1997

Blockstream founder and Hashcash inventor Adam Back [writes](http://mailing-list-archive.cryptoanarchy.wiki/archive/1997/05/ef17e389556d2b6e27e8e0036a85ce1fedc73e2de871cc30728e7fc8be3d7f09/) 
on the Cypherpunk Mailing List that a successful digital cash project must be ultra low cost to transact with.

>What we want is fully anonymous, *ultra low transaction cost,* transferable units of exchange.  If we get that going the banks will become the obsolete dinasaurs they deserve to become.

#### May 1999

Nick Szabo publishes [*Micropayments and Mental Transaction Costs.*](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/static/docs/micropayments-and-mental-transaction-costs.pdf) The paper argues against the viability of online micropayments and suggests security is a more important investment than reducing network resource usage to enable cheaper transactions.

>A lesson for micropayment efforts is that mental costs usually exceed, and
often dwarf, the computational costs. Reductions in the per transaction computational costs of transactions may often be economically insignificant. Other transaction costs addressable by hardware or software, such as security concerns,
as well as costs of better communicating product quality versus price tradeoffs
in the user interface, are usually more important ob jectives for technological
cost reduction than conserving on computational or network resources.

#### 22 January 2006

Future Blockstream Cofounder Greg Maxwell is [accused of vandalism, bullying, terrorist sympathizing, sockpupettry and more on Wikipedia.](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/45ail1/wikipedians_on_greg_maxwell_in_2006_now_cto_of/)

>(Copied from WP:AN/3RR, because there were edits that amounted to vandalism, as well as excessive reverting)
>
>He has reverted Template:User freedom seven times despite repeated calls to stop from multiple editors. The version he is reverting to is far different from what the creators and users intended it for. I consider these edits to be an act of vandalism.

>I'm also surprised by the length of the block, because he was engaged in vandalism, not just edit warring. I'd block him myself but I was involved in a dispute with him over an image recently. Three examples of the edits I see as vandalism: he changed a box supporting the American military to one supporting the Iraqi insurgents. He inserted an image of a woman "hogtied" and gagged into a box opposing fox hunting, and changed the fox hunting link to BDSM. On Template:Wikiproject Terrorism, he replaced the image of a terrorist with one of a nuclear explosion.  

>Alert to all admins. Gmaxwell is going around to every user page that displays any kind of thumbnail or flag from Wikipedia Commons and declaring them "copyright violation". He is then blanking the user page and putting up a copyright violation notice. Is there any justification for this?

>Yes, I inadvertently fell foul of that a while ago. On that occasion, though, the person who alerted me merely removed the image and left me a polite note in explanation. Gmaxwell has for some time been behaving very oddly and aggressively with regard to image violations (real or occasionally imagined). Here, he's misapplying a rule about fair-use images to the use of public-domain images, and doing so in a heavy-handed manner.

>I've spoken to him several times about his aggression, since a dispute I had with him recently about an image (in which he called me "hysterical" and accused me of vandalism because I dared to revert his removal of it). What with this today and his behavior last night (see above), I'm unsure of the best way is to proceed, but something needs to happen.

>His behaviour is outrageous. Firstly, where fairuse images are wrongly on user pages it is invariably due to a misunderstanding, not an attempt to break the law. All he had to do was leave a message, not post a massive notice all but accusing the user of being a lawbreaker. Secondly, he is not removing the offending image, but all images, even those that can be displayed. Thirdly, blanking a user's page is grossly disrespectful to other users. Frankly, he is out of control at this stage. This bullying behavour of his has to stop.

>I move that all his edits be reverted and considered petty vandalism, and that the said user be blocked for a period of one week. We don't have time to entertain him or his dubious edits.

>OK, his contribs list is beyond the pale. It's vandalism, pretty clearly.

>On the evidence, it seems that Majorityrule was a sockpuppet of Gmaxwell. I have extended Maxwell's block to one week. Given his behaviour, if they are an admin perhaps a move should be made to have them desysoped.

>He isn't an admin and supeficially performing exactly the same set of edits does suggest a sock puppet (my initial reaction), though of course it's possible that it is someone up to mischief.

>He's not known for making "reasonable, patient attempts to protect the Foundation," unfortunately, but for acts of aggression that have led other users to leave the project. I'm concerned that, in his most recent statements, he has announced his intention to continue being disruptive, and has said he'll evade any blocks that are applied. That's a direct threat to the project, not an attempt to protect it.

>Today he seemed to indicate he has no intention of following our policies:
>
>"Like I give a crap about being blocked, it doesn't even inhibit me from editing."
>
>"Man. You think I've stopped because I'm blocked? Please! Blocking doesn't actually stop anyone but twits!" 
>
>"You're still wrong about me being blocked accomplishing *anything*, since I can still edit whenever I please... in fact, being blocked gives me far less incentive to be nice about it, in so far as there can be far less than nearly none at all."
>
>"I feel great because I can still do what I want, and I don't have to worry what rude jerks think about me ... I can continue to do whatever I think is right without the burden of explaining myself to a shreaking [sic] mass of people." 
>
>That's not even to mention the personal attacks.

>My opinion of this user is that he is a very dangerous individual whose edits speak for themselves. Full of sarcasm, threats, rude insults, impersonations of an admin, not to mention massive disprect of other users and blanking of user pages. I'm all about forgiving, but this is banable behavior. If further incidents occur, a ban would be warranted. 

#### 14 July 2010

A <code>max_block_size</code> [value of 1MB](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/a30b56ebe76ffff9f9cc8a6667186179413c6349#diff-118fcbaaba162ba17933c7893247df3aR2614) set on the client.

#### 22 July 2010

The Bitcoin.org website on [Wayback Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20100722094110/http://www.bitcoin.org:80/) lists the main advantages of Bitcoin on the homepage. In bold, it says:

> Bitcoin transactions are practically free, whereas credit cards and online payment systems typically cost 1-5% per transaction plus various other merchant fees up to hundreds of dollars.

#### 19 September 2010

After some discussion, Hal Finney, Satoshi (Bitcoin’s creator), and the user ‘Cryddit,’ who is Ray Dallingerr, on Bitcointalk imposed a [1MB default block size](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/172f006020965ae8763a0610845c051ed1e3b522) to reduce the chance of spam transactions hijacking blockspace, or the possibility of cheap DoS attacks. [Cryddit below explains why this limit was put in place:](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=946236.msg10388435#msg10388435)

>I'm the guy who went over the blockchain stuff in Satoshi's first cut of the bitcoin code.  Satoshi didn't have a 1MB limit in it. The limit was originally Hal Finney's idea.  Both Satoshi and I objected that it wouldn't scale at 1MB.  Hal was concerned about a potential DoS attack though, and after discussion, Satoshi agreed.  The 1MB limit was there by the time Bitcoin launched.  But all 3 of us agreed that 1MB had to be temporary because it would never scale.
>
>Several attempted "abuses" of the blockchain under the 1MB limit have proved Hal right about needing the limit at least for launching purposes.  A lot of people wanted to piggyback extraneous information onto the blockchain, and before miners (and the community generally) realized that blockchain space was a valuable resource they would have allowed it.  The blockchain would probably be several times as big a download now if that limit hadn't been in place, because it would have a lot of random 1-satoshi transactions that exist only to encode information for altcoins etc.
>
>At this point I don't think random schmoes who would allow just any transaction are getting a  lot of blocks. The people who have made a major investment in hashing power are doing the math to figure out which tx are worthwhile to include because block propagation time (and therefore the risk of orphan blocks) is proportional to block size. So at this point I think blockchain bloat as such is no longer likely to a problem, and the 1MB limit is no longer necessary.  It has been more-or-less replaced by a profitability limit that motivates people to not waste blockchain bandwidth, and miners are now reliably dropping transactions that don't pay fees. 

#### 01 December 2010

One of the [earliest posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eef3h/a_short_introduction_to_bitcoin_a_peer_to_peer/) on r/Bitcoin is made linking to an article titlted *A Short Introduction to Bitcoin - A Peer to Peer Cryptocurrency.* The [linked article](https://bluishcoder.co.nz/2010/10/10/a-short-introduction-to-bitcoin.html) describes the author's interest in Bitcoin's ability to offer micropayments.

>I'm interested in the approach of using bitcoin as a way to do micro-transactions and ease online payments and donations.

#### 19 July 2011

r/bitcoin moderator u/AtlasLGo is [accused](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=30211.0) of trying to sell r/bitcoin. In the ensuing drama, someone contacts Reddit and he is removed along with three other mods we can see on the [WayBack Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20110530125818/https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/new/) as late as May 2011.

Theymos becomes the new sole [moderator](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=30211.msg381922#msg381922) and refuses to allow the old ones back in. We see him as the sole moderator on the WayBack machine in [September 2011.](https://web.archive.org/web/20110927021847/https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/new/)

Now former moderator u/edzillion [recounted](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/84djb8/did_theymos_purchase_rbitcoin_in_2011/dvqcdvp?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) the story years later: 

>Atlas was basically inactive - it seemed the modding was going just fine (it was a very positive community in those early days) but then one day without any warning we were all kicked. It seems atlas was chatting with people over IRC and they were like how can you sell it? and he booted all the other mods in preparation for a sale.
>
>This caused a total shitstorm, as you can imagine, and the community basically shouted loud enough that the orig mod backed down and agreed to hand it over to whoever the community decided, which was theymos.
>
>Theymos wasn't much better - wouldn't re-add any of the kicked mods and held it alone himself on some kind of power trip. Things got quite unfriendly after that - partially because theymos is a typical angry asshole libertarian, and partially because the scene grew so much that it was hard to maintain a close community.
>
>After a while of lobbying to get back in and failing, I gave up on it but I still feel disabused by that situation. I put a lot of good work into making bitcoin and r/bitcoin what it is today. We were all crazy wide-eyed zealots back then shouting it from the rooftops. I figured I at least deserved some kind of explanation, let alone my modship (which, let's face it is a somewhat useful position in the btc world).

#### 30 July 2011

Greg Maxwell suggests that [Bitcoin can scale and remain decentralized.](https://web.archive.org/web/20140328052630/https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Talk:Scalability)

>When techies hear about how bitcoin works they frequently stop at the word "flooding" and say "Oh-my-god! that can't scale!". The purpose of this article is to take an extreme example, the peak transaction rate of Visa, and show that bitcoin could technically reach that kind of rate without any kind of questionable reasoning, changes in the core design, or non-existent overlays. As such, it's merely an extreme example— not a plan for how bitcoin will grow to address wider needs (as a decentralized system it is the bitcoin using public who will decide how bitcoin grows)— it's just an argument that shows that bitcoin's core design can scale much better than an intelligent person might guess at first.
>
>Dan rightly criticizes the analysis presented here— pointing out that operating at this scale would significantly reduce the decentralized nature of bitcoin: If you have to have many terabytes of disk space to run a "full validating" node then fewer people will do it, and everyone who doesn't will have to trust the ones who do to be honest. Dan appears (from his slides) to have gone too far with that argument: he seems to suggest that this means bitcoins will be controlled by the kind of central banks that are common today. His analysis fails for two reasons (and the second is the fault of this page being a bit misleading):
>
>First, even at the astronomic scale presented here the required capacity is well within the realm of (wealthy) private individuals, and certainly would be at some future time when that kind of capacity was required. A system which puts private individuals, or at least small groups of private parties, on equal footing with central banks could hardly be called a centralized one, though it would be less decentralized than the bitcoin we have today. The system could also not get to this kind of scale without bitcoin users agreeing collectively to increase the maximum block size, so it's not an outcome that can happen without the consent of bitcoin users.

#### 23 October 2014

Blockstream [announces](https://blockstream.com/2014/10/23/en-why-we-are-co-founders-of-blockstream/) itself to the world on their blog.

>...we propose technology to enable new cryptocurrency networks that do not need new cryptocurrencies (see our sidechains whitepaper for more information, as well as read an interview with the Wall Street Journal BitBeat). Delivering on this vision will require continued investment in and cooperation with the Bitcoin ecosystem as a whole, along with the full-time support of many people with broad and specialized backgrounds. 

#### 06 November 2014

Early Bitcoin adopter Stefan Molyneux makes a video predicting that [Bitcoin will be taken over and the methods by which it will happen.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-sMbf2OzOY&feature=youtu.be)

>Let's not kill it outright. It's big enough now that people will see what we've done. What they're going to try to do is throw little bits of sand in it until most people find it too cumbersome to use. That is the great danger.

[Blockstream closes a $21M seed round.](https://blockstream.com/2014/11/17/en-blockstream-closes-21m-seed-round/) “Can’t be evil" is the informal motto.

#### 12 June 2015

Chinese miners signed a statement that they want [8MB blocks.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3a0n4m/why_upgrade_to_8mb_but_not_20mb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) Signatories included the large mining companies F2pool, BTCChina, Antpool, Huobi, and BW.

![Miners Want Big Blocks](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*3fpU-5KaDHJjXFao.)

In an article translated on Medium, the miners argue:

>If the current network is incapable of supporting blocks larger than 1MB, then Core’s insistence on the block size limit is understandable. But actually, even with the Great Firewall in place, Chinese mining pools have all said they want an 8MB block size.

#### 13 August 2015

/u/aminok has his post [(archive)](https://archive.is/E75Cx#selection-1969.95-1969.299) deleted, in which he asked the mods: “please don’t try to impose your will on the Bitcoin community.” 

>Allow posts that promote hard forks in the sub. A hard fork to raise the hard limit has been part of the development plan for Bitcoin since 2010. Posts about it are entirely appropriate for this subreddit.

Bitcoin entrepreneur Ryan Selkis asks Adam Back publicly if [he is seriously contemplating a class action lawsuit](https://twitter.com/twobitidiot/status/633092083042099201?s=20) against Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen if they move forward with Bitcoin XT.

>@adam3us is it true you've contemplated joining a class action lawsuit against gavin & mike if they go through with the hard fork?

Adam Back [replies,](https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/633093049397063680?s=20) seemingly acknowledging that he directly or indirectly supports the idea of a lawsuit to stop Bitcoin XT.

> if you lost your Bitcoins as a result of Gavin network split - would you hold him accountable?

He goes on to suggest that Gavin could be held [criminally negligent](https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/633119949943275520?s=20) for supporting Bitcoin XT and compares him to Mark Karples of the infamous Mt. Gox exchange.

Bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik [responds,](https://twitter.com/jgarzik/status/633097876877348864?s=20) tagging Adam Back and Bitcoin Twitter personality Pierre Rochard, [who detailed](https://twitter.com/JackGavigan/status/698503931312394240?s=20) plans for a lawsuit in another Tweet:

>Turning to lawsuits implies you have lost both the tech argument and the community.

Cryptographer Ian Grigg [agrees.](https://twitter.com/iang_fc/status/633109258675073024?s=20)

Blockstream [raises $55 Million in a Series A Funding Round,](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-startup-blockstream-raises-55-million-in-funding-round-1454518655) one of the largest investments in a Bitcoin company ever. 

AXA Ventures co-leads the round. Bitcoiners are quick to point out that the [CEO of AXA, Henri de Castries, has been the Chairman of the Bilderberg Group since 2012](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/47zfzt/blockstream_is_now_controlled_by_the_bilderberg/) and that their ties to the traditional central banking industry and political aparatus are a huge conflict of interest in a cryptocurrency that was ostensibily designed to help make them less powerful.

>They are bankers and politicians and special interest VC groups who have literally everything to lose with something like Bitcoin taking prominence over their engineered financial farce conducted over 100 years. The greatest fraud in human history as far as I am concerned.
>
>They want to turn Bitcoin into a piece of legacy banking garbage. They are anti-freedom and anti-freemarket.

#### 22 February 2016

Mosaic Ventures posts an article about their participation in the investment round, stating that Bitcoin is a [technocracy governed by developers.](https://www.mosaicventures.com/mosaicblog/2016/2/4/our-investment-in-blockstream)

>The governance of Bitcoin Core, like many other open source projects, is technocratic, where a handful of “core devs” (a dynamic group that includes several Blockstream team-members) deliberate the merits of various changes to the protocol, and decide how to move the puck forward, hoping to convince each other and the wider industry of their consensus. The technocracy is at least meritocratic, in the sense that the core devs are recognized -- by their peers, the community itself -- based on their significant contributions to the code.

r/bitcoin moderator u/hardleft121 announces he was removed by Theymos as moderator over a week ago and 'thanked' for his services.

Bitstamp announces on an [AMA that they will adopt BIP 101 in December.](https://forum.bitcoin.com/post10195.html#p10195) 

u/cqm responds to the wildly popular [r/bitcoin thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3uu3we/bitstamp_will_switch_to_bip_101_this_december/cxi370c/) that [Theymos will ban them.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3uu3we/bitstamp_will_switch_to_bip_101_this_december/cxhzivx/)

>up next bitstamp banned from r/bitcoin and statement from Theymos with 1200 downvotes

Theymos replies that [he will indeed ban them and is heavily downvoted.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3uu3we/bitstamp_will_switch_to_bip_101_this_december/cxi370c/)

>If they do it, then yes, they will be banned. Very disappointing. I thought that BitStamp was one of the better exchanges.

Using [Removeddit we can see that nearly 10% of the comments on the thread were censored by moderators, some of them quite popular.](http://removeddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3uu3we/bitstamp_will_switch_to_bip_101_this_december/)

One example is a [popular comment by u/KarskOhoi,](http://removeddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3uu3we/_/cxht0jq/) deleted by moderators for supporting the move away from Bitcoin Core and Blockstream.

>Good news. Time to leave Blockstream Core.

Another deleted comment reads:

>Bitcoin is not governed by Blockstream Core. They will understand this when the BIP101 fork happens.

In total, over 80 comments were removed by r/Bitcoin moderators, most of which were unfortunately deleted too quickly for the Removeeddit tool to archive.

Cobra makes a Github issue to [remove Coinbase from the "choose your wallet" page on Bitcoin.org](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/1178) to punish them for running a Bitcoin XT node in addition to their Bitcoin Core node.

>Coinbase is now running Bitcoin XT in their production servers. XT is an contentious hard fork attempt that will create a new altcoin and split the community and blockchain should it ever go into effect. If this ever happens, Coinbase's customers may find that they no longer own any actual Bitcoin.
>
>This pull request removes Coinbase from the "Choose your Wallet" page to protect new users from being on the wrong end of a blockchain fork. Bitcoin.org should only promote Bitcoin services. Companies that use XT don't meet this criteria because they support forking off the blockchain and switching to a new incompatible currency without broad consensus.

>Bitcoin Core has already announced a road map to address scalability concerns. I don't see why @barmstrong feels the need to try to promote XT in this way. Almost all of the Bitcoin technical community supports the announced road map. It's not like things aren't moving forward

One Github user [comments](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/1178#issuecomment-167379700) in support that Coinbase needs to be forced in line.

>ACK. We definitely need to coerce Coinbase into switching back to Bitcoin Core. If we do not take any action, we're setting a dangerous precedent where other wallets and services are allowed to break apart from the consensus.

The issue is on the whole very unpopular thought.

Bitcoin developer [Jameson Lopp comments that Bitcoin XT can become Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/1178#issuecomment-167378735) and removing companies before a fork has happened is premature.

>NACK; the potential for forking does not an altcoin make. Until such time as a BIP101 fork occurs, companies running XT are definitely running Bitcoin. If a hard fork does occur, said companies may still be running Bitcoin - it would have to be judged which fork is the winner post-fork. Removing companies as "not running Bitcoin" when no fork has occurred is jumping the gun.

OB1 Cofounder [Brian Hoffman comments:](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/1178#issuecomment-167456502)

>This is a god damn experiment on their part. Not compliant with the Bitcoin network? Any service allowing registrations and financial software is subject to their locales regulations and guidelines or they go to jail. Why the fuck does that preclude them from being on a list of wallets? This is why you can't give children big boy responsibilities.

>@brian_armstrong Coinbase wallet removed from http://bitcoin.org because you dared to speak up against CoreDev

Despite the unpopularity of the issue, it is committed the following day and Coinbase is removed from Bitcoin.org.

#### 28 December 2015. 

A rogue /r/bitcoin mod going by the username /u/CensorshipIsTheWorst leaked the following conversation from the /r/Bitcoin mod-mail:

>from Aussiehash [M] to /r/Bitcoin sent 1 day ago https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3ycayp/brian_armstrong_on_twitter_coinbase_is_now/ I’ve removed this post for now. I’m happy for other mods to reverse or otherwise.
>
>from theymos [M] via /r/Bitcoin to Aussiehash [M] sent 11 hours ago I agree with removing it because it is mainly about XT. However, AFAICT Coinbase is currently still using Bitcoin and should therefore be allowed on /r/Bitcoinfor now in general. coblee said so in the bitcoin.org pull request, and I tend to trust him. (Perhaps Cobra was unaware of coblee’s reliability, or maybe he [IMO reasonably] considered Coinbase too dangerous/incompetent/reckless to list on bitcoin.org even though they are currently using Bitcoin.)

>from StarMaged [M] via /r/Bitcoin to theymos [M] sent 5 hours ago Honestly, it seems to me that until the moment of the split, they are still a bitcoin company. They are just buying/selling two currencies at once instead of one. I am really uncomfortable with the idea that this policy would encourage companies to silently support XT and then only tell us at the last moment. Yeah, sure, remove those posts as altcoin promotion, but people outside of this subreddit should be allowed to make an informed decision without us scaring companies into censoring themselves. I feel that this is where that term “censorship” might actually be relevant, since our actions here on this issue would affect the speech of a company elsewhere out of fear of retaliation from this subreddit. Something to ponder.

A few hours later, /u/colsatre had his moderator position revoked, leading some to speculate that he was the rogue mod. /u/CensorshipIsTheWorst never posted again.

/u/colsatre wrote later under his own account critisizing Theymos for censorship and said he was removed for not following the [party line.](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/40rqrd/ustarmageds_last_action_as_a_mod_was_great_but/cywu8nz?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

>I didn't leave of my own volition either. Other mods, specifically theymos, weren't happy with actions I took.

>I'm not a fan of sticking around a place where dissenting opinions are liable to be removed...

>I'm one of the regulars from back then that /u/Shadered mentioned, I was a mod here on r/Bitcoin and bitcointalk for a while. Those places are no longer for me!

>He's either extremely incompetent or malicious with the way he went about it. There was no discussion with the rest of the forum staff before giving money to Slickage.
>
>I find it hard to believe that he'd be that stupid. He also refused to answer any questions about it afterwards, which leads me to believe he did something that he knew was shady.
>
>Source - Was a mod of bitcointalk at the time it happened

On an article documenting some of the censorship on r/Bitcoin over the years, he [commented:](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5cue13/john_blocke_a_brief_and_incomplete_history_of/d9zzmkq?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

>Seems to be a very good and accurate write-up!

He also supported [raising the Bitcoin block size to 2mb.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5q1v0q/are_your_transactions_slow_to_confirm_then_ask/dcvseif?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

>Can't we just bump the block size to 2mb?

#### 08 January 2016

A thread in r/Bitcoin titled *Scalability issue is a red-herring* argues Bitcoin is a store of value first and by implication suggests we don't need to raise the block size. The thread has 51 comments and zero upvotes.

Theymos comments in agreement and is heavily downvoted.

>If that requires treating bitcoins like Yap stones, that's still better than what we had before Bitcoin.

u/Uber_Nick responds, questioning Theymos on deleting comments he disagrees with.

>Does "better and freer" mean users won't be banned from discussing ideas that are different than yours?

Theymos replies and is heavily downvoted.

>No one is ever banned for discussing ideas that are different than mine. Banning someone for that reason would be completely at odds with my philosophy of moderation.

Seems rational? But when we use the [Removeddit tool,](http://removeddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/404z6b/scalability_issue_is_a_redherring/) we can see 24% of the comments on the entire are removed, most of which appear to have been in response to Theymos' defense of his moderation policies.

#### 14 January 2016

[*The Bitcoin Lightning Network: Scalable Off-Chain Instant Payments*](https://lightning.network/lightning-network-paper.pdf) is published. 

>The Bitcoin blockchain holds great promise for distributed ledgers, but
the blockchain as a payment platform, by itself, cannot cover the world’s
commerce anytime in the near future.

The paper argues that in order to "achieve much higher than 47,000 transactions per second using
Bitcoin requires conducting transactions off the Bitcoin blockchain itself."

Notably, it also argues that the Lightning Network will require block size increases on Bitcoin up to 133mb in order to work properly.

>If all transactions using Bitcoin were conducted inside a network of
micropayment channels, to enable 7 billion people to make two channels
per year with unlimited transactions inside the channel, it would require
133 MB blocks (presuming 500 bytes per transaction and 52560 blocks per
year). Current generation desktop computers will be able to run a full node
with old blocks pruned out on 2TB of storage.

#### 01 July 2016

Bitcoin.org co-owner 'Cobra' posts on Github that he wants to update the Bitcoin whitepaper because it confuses people. The implication is clear by the timing. Cobra did not want people to think that Bitcoin was meant to scale on-chain.

>I've been noticing that the Bitcoin paper at https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf is getting a lot of traffic (mainly from people searching for "bitcoin paper", or probably seeing it cited by other papers). Almost all the people reading the paper are probably reading it for the first time, and using it as a learning resource. However since the paper is so outdated, I believe it doesn't do a good job anymore of giving people a firm understanding of Bitcoin (at least the modern version). There is no mention of things like pools, and the Privacy and SPV sections could probably be updated.
>
>The paper links to bitcoin.org, but I feel like the Bitcoin described in the paper and the Bitcoin described on bitcoin.org are starting to diverge. At some point, I think the paper will start to do more harm than good, because it tricks people into believing they understand Bitcoin. I have seen people promote toxic and crazy ideas, and then cite parts of the paper in an effort to justify it. Academics are also regularly citing the paper and basing some of their reasoning and arguments on this outdated paper.
>
>Normally issues like this in other projects would be solved by regularly updating the learning resources, and documents, such as producing new editions or versions of the document to keep it in line with the current status of the project. I'd be interested to know the community's thoughts and opinions on this issue, since I know it's likely to be a divisive but some rational debate would be good, because it could become more of a problem in the future.
>
>There are already a few different versions of the paper out there, so Satoshi has already set the precedent that the paper should be updated to reflect the current realities of the software. I believe the paper was always designed to be a high level overview of the current reference implementation, and that we should update it now that the paper is outdated and the reference implementation has changed significantly from 2009.

The thread is heavily downvoted.

A user named Rudd-O [replies](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/1325#issuecomment-230184015) and is strongly critical. 

>The concept of "amending a paper" written by a first party author by way of a third-party author mangling is absurd, and it is a crime in quite a few jurisdictions.
>
>Morally, I say don't lie to people by mangling the original writeup. It exists where it exists for a reason. Altering the original paper to "update it" is a perversion of the very idea of a published paper. If you want it to be updated, talk to Satoshi. He can publish a second version.
>
>In the meantime, publish an updated paper yourself. Under your name.
>
>Whoever is distributing forged versions of the paper should be prosecuted for plagiarism.

Greg Maxwell calls him a ['pseudonymous armchair provocateur'](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/1325#issuecomment-230186527) and suggests that Cobra has a point and that seriuos discussion about changing the whitepaper is needed.

>In this case, Cobra pointed out that many people land on the Bitcoin whitepaper page after searching "bitcoin paper". Presumably, some of these people are just looking for a good background on Bitcoin, and for this purpose they are not that well served by the whitepaper as of its last update because it contains some inaccuracies (and a few things that eight more years of experience has taught us are easily misunderstood). 

He accuses Rudd-O of 'online violence' and refers to Bitcoin.org as Cobra's "own space."

>Here you wax on about censorship yet you see fit to make demands not just on what someone publishes on their own website, but respond with online violence to people who are simply discussing some things you don't like, in their own space. 

Greg is heavily downvoted.

Luke Dashjr [responds in support.](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/1325#issuecomment-230078395)

>Sounds reasonable as long as it's clear it isn't the original paper. Maybe an updated HTML version, with a clear link to the original at the top?

He is heavily downvoted.

[Theymos replies to the thread as well](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/1325#issuecomment-230082608) and suggests the whitepaper be annotated to correct errors Satoshi made and misunderstandings people might have.

>Interesting suggestion. The paper is definitely outdated, and I do often see people saying "just read the whitepaper!" as if the paper is still a good way to learn about Bitcoin. On the other hand, the paper is an important piece of history. It's still an impressive document, even if not the most useful nowadays, explaining most of how Bitcoin works in only a few pages.
>
>Maybe it would be best to stick several pages of errata and explanation to the front of the PDF, but leave Satoshi's pages untouched. Having bitcoin.pdf redirect to an HTML page would also work...

He is heavily downvoted too, and a look at the entire history clearly shows the idea was wildly unpopular.

#### 14 March 2017

CCN publishes an article detailing a threat made by Bitcoin Core supporter Ciphera to [attack the Bitcoin Unlimited node network.](https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-core-supporter-threatens-zero-day-exploit-bitcoin-unlimited-hardforks/)

Hours later, after a bug in the Bitcoin Unlimited node software is disclosed, developers quickly [patch the bug on Github.](https://github.com/BitcoinUnlimited/BitcoinUnlimited/pull/371/files)

Bitcoin Core developer [Peter Todd tweets about the bug in the next hour](https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/841702092687450113) before the nodes are updated with the fix, an act which many considered irresponsible because it popularizes the bug to potential attackers. There are [differing accounts](https://www.ccn.com/caused-bitcoin-unlimited-node-crash/) of when whether it started before or after Peter's tweet, but at some point an attack exploiting the bug on Bitcoin Unlimited nodes begins, taking many offline.

Many on Twitter and [r/Bitcoin celebate the attack.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5zdkv3/bitcoin_unlimited_remote_exploit_crash/) A hotfix to allow Bitcoin Unlimited nodes to continue working is released and posted on r/Bitcoin, but the [post is immediately deleted by r/Bitcoin moderators.](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5zeo5p/the_censorship_on_rbitcoin_is_completely_reckless/dexpzih/)

![BU Fix](http://i.imgur.com/WGNiuJ7.png)

u/TheTT [recounts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5zdkv3/bitcoin_unlimited_remote_exploit_crash/dexiun0/) what happened as he observed it: 

>They actually put out a fix before this whole madness got started - the attackers got the idea from the public fix. It should also be noted that Peter Todds tweet likely made it spread around the larger community. Completely irresponsible behaviour. Doesnt make the BU code less shitty, but still. It really shows that people just want to hurt each other, not further the ecosystem.

Big-blocker Paul Wasensteiner [writes that this is an act of war against Bitcoin Unlimited](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5zeo5p/the_censorship_on_rbitcoin_is_completely_reckless/dexpzih/) and describes what he saw:

>The entire front page is them cheering about the attack on BU, yet they censor the fix.
>
>I mean, I cannot possibly comprehend how things got this way.
>
>An influential core developer announces a bug in a bitcoin client in the most public place possible, after the bug has already been fixed but has not been pushed out yet, for the sole purpose of causing as much damage as possible. A core supporter then uses the bug to attack the network and take hundreds of nodes of the network. Then the main bitcoin subreddit fills with every single post cheering that an attack has happened on the network and that it is great. Then a hotfix is released to allow bitcoin nodes to continue operating as usual, but the main bitcoin subreddit then censors the fix.
Just let that sink in a second.

An issue is open on the Bitcoin.org Github account titled [*Removal of BTC.com wallet?*](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/16600)

>BTC.com was one of the The Future of Bitcoin Conference 2017 sponsors. At the conference well known fraudster and patent troll Craig Wright attacked bitcoin users and core devs.
>
While I don't have a problem with supporting a conference that gives different opinions (e.g BU) a platform, I draw the line when they give a dangerous egomaniac a platform for his FUD and hate.
>
While this is not against the bitcoin.org wallet inclusion rules, it shows at best poor judgement and at worst the desire to harm bitcoin.
>
>Maybe I am totally out of line here but I would like to hear from BTC.com (@bitkevin) if they knew that Craig was one of the speakers and if they support his views on Bitcoin.

Cobra replies that he doesn't mind if they are [removed from the website](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/1660#issuecomment-312738631) as punishment because of their association with Jihan Wu and therefore, big block efforts.

>To be clear, it isn't up to any of us. A good portion of the community
wants to keep the legacy chain. NYA signers are free to create a hard fork,
but not adding replay protection suggests intent to destroy the legacy
chain. As long as a lot of people still want the legacy chain, attempts to
destroy it will be treated as an attack on the property of all these
people. It constitutes a serious cyberattack and decisive action against
it, both technical and legal, has been prepared.

#### 11 September 2017

Bitcoin Core developer and Blockstream Cofounder Matt Corallo submits a [filing](https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-nysearca-2017-06/nysearca201706-161046.htm) to the Securities and Exchange Commission to ask them to step in and protect consumers from attempts to create a new Bitcoin.

>I am Matt Corallo, a long-time developer of Bitcoin (around the 10th publicly recorded individual to contribute to the Bitcoin codebase), an expert on Bitcoin's operation, vocal Bitcoin advocate, and strong proponent of the availability of a Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Product (ETP).
>
>I have very grave concerns with the proposed rules for the maintaining of Bitcoin deposits and the lack of consumer protection in the event of Bitcoin Network rule changes in the current filings.
>
>As described in the S-1 filing for the "Bitcoin Investment Trust" (BIT), a "permanent fork" of Bitcoin may occur when two groups of users disagree as to the rules which define the system (its "consensus rules"). More specifically, such a "permanent fork" is likely to occur when one group of users wish to make a change to Bitcoin's consensus rules, while another group does not. This leads to two cryptocurrencies, and may lead to significant ambiguity around which should be referred to as "Bitcoin".

#### 28 September 2017

Cobra opens a Github issue for Bitcoin.org labeled [*Add Segwit2x Safety Alert.*](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/1824) The alert ostensibly warns users of hostile companies, but the list includes most of the oldest, most successful Bitcoin companies, and the real goal seems to be to scare or punish these companies for their stance on Segwit 2x.


>This adds a new alert warning users about storing any BTC in Coinbase, Bitpay and Xapo. These companies continue ahead with their plan to hard fork away from consensus, and so this alert is necessary to make sure users are informed enough about the incoming threat.
>
>Thoughts? Feedback? I've tried to keep it fairly short, and I don't want this to grow into a huge complex document full of a million different things. I think the key part is to just tell people to get their coins off these dangerous services, and I think this alert accomplishes that pretty well.
>
>I've made this into a red alert because I think this incoming hard fork is possibly the greatest threat to Bitcoin, so a red warning is necessary to catch people's attention. I want as many as possible to know what these insidious companies are planning so we can prevent them quietly pushing it through. Raising awareness is key. I'm going to be suspicious of anyone changing this document in such a way as to make the issue seem like less of a danger and trying to "tone it down" without clear well thought out reasons.

The proposal is heavily downvoted on Github. Longtime Bitcoin entrepreneur Erik Vorhees [comments on Twitter:](https://twitter.com/ErikVoorhees/status/918126175758598146)

>Glad to see many of the rational comments on https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/1824 regarding http://bitcoin.org's highly political message today.

#### 05 October 2017

Despite the unpopularity of Bitcoin.org's Segwit Safety Alert proposal, they [post on their blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20171028193101/https://bitcoin.org/en/posts/denounce-segwit2x) their intentions to activate the alert in the coming days, along with a blacklist of companies that includes Coinbase, BitPay, Bitcoin.com, Blockchain.com, BTC.com and more. 

They also list 'guidelines' for companies to be removed from the list. The entire article is shared below.

>On 2017-10-11 at noon (UTC), Bitcoin.org is planning to publish a banner on every page of the site warning users about the risks of using services that will default to the so-called Segwit2x1 (S2X) contentious hard fork. S2X companies will be called out by name. To ensure that we only warn users against companies that will actually put user deposits at risk, we urge all companies to publicly clarify their stance before the above date, either by a highly-visible public statement or by commenting on Bitcoin.org issue #1835 (or by doing both).
>
>In particular, we need to know that:
>
>- The company will not under any circumstances list “Segwit2x” as “BTC” and/or “Bitcoin”. Note that Bitcoin is not ruled by miners, and miner actions cannot be used as a justification to redefine Bitcoin.
>
>- The company will not by default do anything that would deprive users of their bitcoins (by eg. using S2X software without addressing replay attacks2, selling user bitcoins automatically, crediting BTC deposits only as S2X deposits, etc.). Providing access to S2X-coins is acceptable, however.
>
>- The company will continue to provide normal service to Bitcoin (ie. non-S2X) users.
>
>Although bitcoin.org condemns contentious hard fork attempts such as S2X, we consider it tolerable for companies to support S2X in ways that do not contradict the above three points, such as by supporting both Bitcoin and S2X simultaneously as separate cryptocurrencies.

The article is notable for many reasons, particularly the claim that "Segwit2x has nothing to do with Segwit."

#### 06 October 2017

[Blockstream Chief Strategy Officer Samson Mow tags the New York Department of Financial Services on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Excellion/status/916491407270879232?s=20) and asks if Coinbase is breaking any rules and engaging in fraud in supporting Segwit 2X.

The threat is clear: if you support Segwit 2X, Blockstream will use state regulatory bodies to punish you.

#### 11 October 2017

[The Segwit Safety Alert activates on Bitcoin.org.](https://web.archive.org/web/20171029022533/https://bitcoin.org/en/) A red banner stating *Beware of Bitcoin's possible incompatibility with some major services* appears on every page.

![Segwit Safety Alert](https://i.imgur.com/Ghe8T21.png)

The linked article is shared in full below.

> **Summary**
>
>A subsection of the Bitcoin economy including prominent businesses such as Coinbase, Xapo, and BitPay have signed an agreement to adopt and implement a contentious hard fork of Bitcoin sometime in November. A hard fork is a backwards incompatible change to the Bitcoin network. This hard fork is not supported by the majority of the Bitcoin users and developers and is therefore a contentious hard fork. By adopting this hard fork, we believe the supporters of this agreement are shifting their users to an alternative currency (an altcoin) which is incompatible with Bitcoin.
>
>The signatories of this agreement wrongly believe that the currency created by adopting this contentious hard fork will eventually become Bitcoin. Therefore storing any BTC on services such as Coinbase, Bitpay and Xapo is strongly not recommended. By storing BTC on these services, you could find that after the hard fork, your BTC has been renamed to something else or replaced entirely with the new altcoin. The best way to ensure that your BTC is protected is to download the latest version of Bitcoin Core and transfer out any BTC stored on services that are a signatory to this agreement. We have listed the businesses supporting this contentious hard fork at the bottom of this document.
>
>For users who aren’t prepared to install Bitcoin Core and go through the lengthy set up process, we recommend a wallet such as GreenAddress, Electrum or TREZOR. Avoid using web wallets like blockchain.info. However users should only use these wallets to store their coins and never perform transactions until well after the hard fork. Any transactions you make on the Bitcoin blockchain can also be replicated and “replayed” on the altcoin chain. If the coins on the contentious hard fork have any value, there will be methods you can use to “split” your coins and have access to them. Pay extra attention to major Bitcoin communication channels and media shortly after the fork so you stay informed.

>**Mobile wallets**

>Miners in Bitcoin are responsible for transaction ordering through putting transactions into blocks, and collectively creating a chain of these blocks. Most mobile wallets depend on blindly trusting the longest chain produced by the miners in order to safely send and receive transactions. There is considerable mining power supporting the contentious hard fork. A majority of miners have pledged to support the contentious hard fork, therefore the longest chain as seen by most mobile wallets may not be the true block chain. As a result of this, spending money from a mobile wallet during a hard fork is dangerous. You will be vulnerable to many attacks as your wallet is not aware that the miners are breaking the consensus rules on the longest chain.

>If the contentious hard fork has failed and the majority of miners have broken their pledge to support the hard fork, it is safe to continue using mobile wallets, however you should check multiple sources of Bitcoin news such as this website, /r/bitcoin, and the Bitcoin Forum to make sure that it’s safe to continue using your particular wallet. As a general rule, you should not perform any transactions during and shortly after the hard fork.
>
>**After the fork**
>
>Blocks may be slower shortly after the hard fork and your transactions will take longer to confirm. You will have to pay a higher transaction fee if your transaction is high priority and you want it confirmed in the next block. You should try to get any important transactions done a few days before the hard fork date. A lot of websites and programs will likely pop up around the time of the hard fork offering to split your Bitcoin so you can have access to both your BTC and to the new altcoin created by this contentious hard fork, you should exercise caution as many of these services are likely to be scams trying to steal your bitcoin. As the hard fork has very little replay protection, most transactions you perform on the Bitcoin network will also be valid on the hard fork network. You should keep this in mind when transacting.

>Some services may continue to present and name the altcoin created by this contentious hard fork as Bitcoin. Users should be aware that this new currency is not Bitcoin. Bitcoin can only be changed with the overwhelming consensus of the entire Bitcoin community of individuals, miners, developers and economy. Even when there is overwhelming consensus, unless in an emergency, a hard fork should have at least a year notice period to give enough time for users to upgrade. This hard fork being adopted by the signatories of this agreement achieves none of these things. It is a rushed and hasty upgrade which only has minority community support and has been thoroughly rejected by users and the technical community. As this new altcoin is not Bitcoin, Bitcoin.org will not list wallets and services that present this altcoin as “Bitcoin” or “BTC” to their users after the hard fork. These services have exited the Bitcoin system in a contentious manner and therefore are no longer useful to our visitors.

The article then lists again all the businesses that are supporting Segwit 2x.

Bitcoin Core Twitter and YouTube personality Richard Heart is allegedly [exposed online as an online spammer](reddit.com/r/btc/comments/79y40b/scammer_alert_you_know_the_narcissist_guy_who/) who trained customers to [send millions of unsolicited emails](https://web.archive.org/web/20070821235025/http://mail.nl.linux.org/linux-crypto/2003-05/msg00129.html) per day.

>I don't know how this flew under the radar but this is very interesting. Richard Heart was a nobody just a few short months ago. Literally nobody had heard of him until this year. Then all of a sudden out of nowhere he was someone where he himself claimed he was a "thought leader" and started creating these multi hour long videos where he would do nothing but talk shit about big blockers, talk shit about Bitcoin Cash and pump Core and Blockstream as much as possible...They outed him after discovering his past where he was a HUGE SPAMMER, running scams and hanging with murderers and criminals - I KID YOU NOT. He also has a bunch of fake identities including legit fake passports and fake IDs. This guy is not your run of the mill troll. He is a full on scammer with a shady as fck past!
m
Richard's [first Bitcoin video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgNh43veB3Q) appeared right after the Bitcoin Cash hardfork and strongly critisized big-blockers while supporting Segwit. He would would go on make several popular videos during the height of the scaling wars invovlving BTC, Segwit 2X, and Bitcoin Cash.

Twitter personality Pierre Rochard [threatens Roger Ver and Brian Armstrong](https://twitter.com/pierre_rochard/status/943870400840306694?s=20) with legal action by implication over the naming of 'Bitcoin Cash.'

>Will they also accuse judges and juries of being "retarded" if they rule that the two phrases too similar? 

Pierre had [previously argued](http://archive.is/iVzMs) that disputes over Bitcoin forks should be settled in court, not markets.

#### 21 May 2018

Blockstream's Chief Strategy Officer Samson Mow asks for an [SEC investigation](https://twitter.com/Excellion/status/976628574919671808?s=20) into CNBC for discussing Bitcoin Cash and jail time.

>Nice selective timeframe to pump the $BCH altcoin to your viewers. May as well make a graphic putting it on a throne for dramatic effect right? Seriously, if these guys at @CNBC aren’t in jail by year end, someone isn’t doing their job.  @SEC_Enforcement

He asks if there are any [current investigations.](https://twitter.com/Excellion/status/998650624370663425?s=20)

>My question is if there are any pending investigations into @CNBCFastMoney by @SEC_News for @BKBrianKelly and other staff pumping and dumping $BCH, or accepting bribes to market the altcoin to investors.

He also [asks for material he can send the SEC directly.](https://twitter.com/Excellion/status/998762417470373888?s=20)

>Collecting some gems for @SEC_Enforcement @SEC_News to take a closer look at @CNBCFastMoney @CNBC pumping and dumping altcoins on their viewers. Enough is enough. If you have more tweets, post below and I’ll add them to the Moment. 

Blockstream 'contractor' and Bitcoin Core developer Luke Dashjr joins in and tells a now-deleted Bitcoin Cash account that [Bitcoin Cashers will be jailed.](https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/976677047589396480?s=20)

>Maybe after some of you start ending up in jail, you'll stop trying to advertise your altcoin as something it isn't (Bitcoin).

#### 21 July 2018

Cobra creates a [Github issue proposing to redo the long-standing informational video on Bitcoin.org.](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/2535#issue-343348067) From his comment, we can tell his concern is that users would think that Bitcoin is meant to be used for payments.

>...Claims fees are low which is not necessarily true...
>
>Overall the video just feels... empty. Anyone who watches it won't even get close to a true understanding of what Bitcoin is. It just presents Bitcoin as something slightly better than PayPal. I think it's better if we get a new more up to date video made.

It is notable that nobody had ever complained about the video and the impression it left newcomers with about Bitcoin for years.

#### 11 August 2018

Cobra creates a Github issue to discuss [relisting companies that were removed from Bitcoin.org for supporting the 2mb hard fork block size increase.](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/2577) His reasoning is that the delisting *worked* to stop the increase and that these companies are unlikely to try it again.

>After the whole S2X situation, we removed links to many of the businesses that had signed the NYA. The site doesn't mention Coinbase, Xapo, BitPay, BTC.com, etc. I think enough time has passed for us to reconsider the situation. The removal and subsequent period of not linking to them was reasonable, since these companies could have attempted another contentious hard fork shortly after S2X failed, but time has shown that they've completely failed and given up at taking over Bitcoin, and are unlikely to try again.
>
>I believe that attacks on Bitcoin through manipulating large economic actors like Coinbase are a thing of the past. 

Theymos [replies and says they should not be relisted](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/2577) unless they publicly apologize and issue a statement on why they were wrong.

>As far as I can tell, if they don't do anything like that again, it'll be because it's become too difficult now, not because they've learned from it. So I wouldn't re-add them unless they admit their mistakes and in particular acknowledge that Bitcoin is not governed, especially not by miners.'

#### 26 December 2018

Samson Mow cheers and threatens Bitcoin Cash Association creator Paul Wasensteiner's arrest and [tags the SEC on Twitter.](https://twitter.com/excellion/status/1078051212052684800)

>You’ll see real cheering when you and your wife go to jail for using @CNBCFastMoney to pump and dump #Bcash on noobs. @SEC_Enforcement.

#### 27 May 2019

Former Blockstream Cofounder Matt Corallo blocks Samson Mow on Twitter, calling it the "best decision" he's ever made and says ["I'm honestly pretty embarrassed to have helped cofound @Blockstream."](https://twitter.com/TheBlueMatt/status/1133040768531214338)

He strongly crisizes the [troll culture popular at the company.](https://twitter.com/TheBlueMatt/status/1133042374320562177?s=20)

>The kind of "let's be mean just because it's fun" culture exposed by a number of 
@Blockstream folks and their management is a lot of what's wrong with (a small subset) of the Bitcoin culture.

Greg Maxwell [attempts](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Lightning_Network&diff=prev&oldid=930392324) to have Bitcoin XT scrubbed from the Bitcoin Wikipedia page.

>I feel like this subject could get adequately covered as part of a broader article on consensusless decenteralized payment systems, but considering that lightning is the only such system with even moderately wide deployment and that there aren't a lot of secondary sources on the broader idea... that gets in the way of covering it that way.  There are a lot of bit-rotten obscure cryptocurrency articles that should probably be removed [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Bitcoin_XT#Bitcoin_XT_is_long_defunct_and_the_article_is_massively_out_of_date,_should_this_be_deleted?]

#### 16 December 2019

Former Bitcoin Core YouTube personality Richard Heart claims that he and others [orchestrated a social manipulation campaign in order to put Segwit through on Bitcoin.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UPLA9-ICJg&lc=UgxHNItC2Cyc8zwRMzJ4AaABAg)

>Two years ago we got Segwit. Which we lied and cheated and stealed -- and I was part of the lying and cheating and stealing -- to get Segwit, to get Lightning, which by the way had critical vulnerabilities and lost people's money.

#### 17 February 2020

Greg Maxwell [threatens](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/f5lm9r/how_roger_ver_escaped_taxes/fhzg431?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) to report Roger Ver to the federal government.

>Surely you didn't conceal your assets... that would have been extraordinarily unwise considering how widely you have bragged about your holdings, especially considering that the IRS will pay whistleblowers up to 30% of the underpayment when the total under-paid is at least $2m. But if you did disclose your assets you should be on the list?
