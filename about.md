I've worked in the past for [Bitcoin.com](https://bitcoin.com), [Glockstore,](https://glockstore) and as the Director of Marketing at [Praxis.](https://discoverpraxis.com) 

In a past life, I spoke at universities and conferences around the world on economics and education, and I helped people build careers by skipping college.

I studied Latin and Ancient Greek at the University of Michigan before leaving during my second year. *carthago delenda est...*

## Interests

Some current interests are online and offline privacy and security, Bitcoin, Operation Atlantis, and rare and out-of-print political novels. Many of the things I wrote about in the past no longer interest me. That's not to say I've changed my mind, only that I don't feel I have anything else to say or do on a particular topic.

## About this site

I'm working on much longer articles than I wrote in the past. I figure if you're going to write, you might as well *write.*

Part of that means not putting out a brain fart everyday that gets some clicks and retweets, and instead seriously thinking about what is missing from web that I wish existed. Can I write something definitive on a topic that has never been done before or which is incomplete so that my future self has some useful information? Can I make something that people will read 10 years from now? That's how I'm trying to think now.

### Building a silo

I'm a bit tired of using other people's platforms. The Internet, especially social media, has been propagandized, mean, and dangerous. I'm a bit tired of it, and I aim to replace all my online platforms with this site.

In the future, for example, I'll have a full 'feed' of short social-media-like posts on this site that are syndicated on Twitter and Instagram. Once I've built that, I don't think I'll use social media much at all.

## Colophon

This site is built on Jekyll using a slighly modified version of the Minima theme. It's plain, I know, but it's faster than most sites on the web and as Ogilvy said, *the drama is in what you say, not the typeface.*
