The BSV Ecosystem Chart as of April 30, 2020 records 414 total projects developed at a rate of .8 projects per day.

I've seen this chart shared regularly for months as evidence of all the innovation and development happening in BSV, but I've never seriously taken a look at the projects it lists. This article reviews all the projects and attempts to assess the accuracy of the report.

### 1. BSV Kanban

It took me a long time to find BSV Kanban. Search queries on Twitter for ['BSV Kanban'](https://twitter.com/search?q=bsv%20kanban&src=typed_query&f=live) and ['Bitcoin SV Kanban'](https://twitter.com/search?q=bitcoin%20sv%20kanban&src=typed_query&f=live) don't return anything useful.

I tracked it down on [Github](https://github.com/armedi/bsv-kanban). It hasn't been updated in 4-months and the README says "I made this app to learn how to store data to bsv using moneybutton."

#### Conclusion

I can't find anything else about this project and can't draw any other conclusions than that it is an inactive learning project. 

### 2. Fullcycle

Several Twitter queries don't show anything. A [dead forum link](http://forum.maars.com/viewtopic.php?t=15) I find on Google gives me some clue that it's related to mining, from Google meta data.

I find it on [Github](https://github.com/dfoderick/fullcycle) as well.

>Full Cycle Mining Controller - a workflow message bus microservice architecture for bitcoin mining

The README says it is a monitoring and management system for Bitcoin mining that tracks or does things like "temperature and hash rate of ASIC miners,' 'automatically configure miners with your pool worker accounts,' 'discover new miners on the network,' etc.

![Fullcycle](https://github.com/dfoderick/fullcycle/raw/master/images/FullCycleReact.png?raw=true)

#### Conclusion

It's been 2 years since the last Github commit, which is not necessarily a relevant metric, but I can't find any other information about who is using this project or whether or not it is active.

### 3. Wikisv

~~This is easy because I was at CoinGeek London [thanks to the generosity of Calvin and the help of Ed, and team] when this was announced. ~~

I was wrong as the chart lists BitcoinWiki as well, which is the project I was thinking of. We will cover that later.

One user on [Twitter writes:](https://twitter.com/veganbeefcake/status/1204742328021331969?s=20) "I would happily donate a substantial amount of BSV towards a WikiSV as you described." 

#### Conclusion

I cannot find any useful information on Wikisv. That doesn't mean it doesn't exist, but I don't know where else to look.

### 4. Tocial Chat

Tocial is a Chinese app described as the ['Most Popular Blockchain AGC Photo Social Platform.'](https://tocial.io/) There is not much info on the website and the app links take me to the Apple TestFlight service for beta testers.

It surprises me a service that is in beta would describe itself as 'the most popular' of anything, even if it's in its own category entirely.

I really don't want to download. Is it malware? Will it screw up my phone? Probably not since Apple vets it first, right? Still, I'm worried but I need to be thorough...And at least their [Twitter account is active.](https://twitter.com/tocial_chat)

#### Testing Tocial

I downloaded the app and was prompted to create an account and add some basic personal information. Doing that was easy enough.

When I log in, I see most of the posts made are in Chinese, which isn't surpising. I see @vegard, who is someone I recognize from BSV Twitter has posted a photo of himself. I also see Eli Afram, whom I recognize as well.

The 'Timeline' feature shows a rolling feed of posts that seem to be similar to Instagram's "Discover" feed. There's at least usually a post every day, but seldom many in one day. I don't know if this displays ALL possible posts or just a selection.

Most of the content ranges from, to be blunt, very sexy Asian women to gross BSDM type stuff. There's also a post that says Craig is Satoshi.

#### What I like

Tocial has a neat feature that allows users to upload several photos in a series like Instagram but selectively paywall them with BSV. Users can pay a micropayment, or whatever price set by the owner, to access them instantly.

The paywall seems to mostly be used now for more explicit imagery, but I can imagine something like this being really neat in the future for all types of content creators, not just attractive Asian women.

The app works pretty well. Things load a bit slow as is expected with new apps but the interface is easy enough to follow and I didn't notice anything breaking.

#### What I don't like

It will have a long way to go to gain traction. Sometimes I think it would make more sense to get an existing service to integrate Bitcoin than to replicate one with Bitcoin functionality. The network effects of entrenched social platforms are hard to overcome.

The content is also subpar at best. The women are attractive but I can't imagine spending my days scrolling through the feed for that, and there's really nothing else that's even remotely worth viewing right now.

#### Conclusion

It's a real project. It has a lot of work to do but there's actually some potential here.

### 5. 9k nodes

Once again, it took me a while to find information on this project. According to a video on [The Bitcoin Assocation YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/3Orxl1rKx8Y?t=250), it's a 2d block explorer that shows information in a graph format.

The project looks like it was developed as part of a Hackathon.

The YouTube video links to the [website.](https://9knodes.com/1)

#### Testing it out

It works! And it's actually cool. I can see something like this being more useful than regular block explorers. The way it shows relationships between different data is much more user friendly.

#### What I don't like

I can't find any information on whether or not this is still being developed or any info on the founders. It's also a bit slow and clunky when you open too many data points at once, which is frustrating.

#### Conclusion

It's a neat proof-of-concept. I wish I could find more information. 

### 6. Zakat Network

Zakat is an annual obligatory charitable payment for Muslims, as I understand it. Is this some kind of way to allow Muslims to pay this with Bitcoin SV?

#### Conclusion

I wouldn't know because I can't find ANY information.

### 7. BitcastSV

I already know about BitcastSV because their Twitter account has liked some things I've posted recently. According to their Twitter description:

> The BitCastSV podcast is dedicated to the one and only Bitcoin as described in the Satoshi whitepaper. 

They launched three months ago and have recorded [two episodes on their YouTube channel.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiwOHm0LnbNO1WdU6wxbPVA)

I guess I've got to listen to an [episode...](https://youtu.be/fTVKj1Y2HR0)

#### Conclusion

They have Daniel Krawisz on so the episode is solid. **More people should listen to Daniel.** Daniel rightfully points out that 'speculation' doesn't deserve a bad name. He says a lot of other intelligent things too. And the editing is good!

>The people in BTC thinks that they will succeed by doing what the experts tell them...but that doesn't make sense because if anyone knew what to do to make a lot of money, he wouldn't tell you.

All that said...it's a podcast. I don't really see this as evidence of innovation in BSV. It's more like an add-on and if I were making a chart of the Bitcoin SV Ecosystem, I wouldn't list it, especially one that has only done two episodes in three months.

### 8. ImmortalSV

[ImmortalSV is a web archiving tool](https://immortalsv.com/)that is supposed to take screenshots of websites and archive them on the BSV chain. The idea is to be more immutable than Archive.Today and the Internet Archive.

I have mixed feelings about archive services... on the one hand, they prevent a lot of important information and work from disappearing. On the other hand, I've personally experienced stalkers abusing the archive service with false information. Adding immutability to that might empower them more.

But I'm open to being convinced, and this evaluation is agnostic on the question.

#### Testing it out

I got several error messages and Cloudflare 504 timeouts. It's a neat interface and I know people who have used it successfully, but I tried several browsers and couldn't get it to work.

>Error while fetching website, please try again or contact synfonaut

#### Conclusion

It's a legitimate proof-of-concept project that needs some reliability work.

### 9. Sporestack

[Sporestack](https://sporestack.com/) offers accountless, API-driven VPS hosting for Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV, and Monero.

This is awesome. I'm sorry to say I'd never heard of it before. There's a lot you can do with it like spinning up servers for a day and running servers for projects that are...against the terms of service.

Here's what they say on their about page.

>Let's say you run a dark web ebook market. The ebooks are full of illegal wrongthink. You're on the run from the Feds and want this market to stay online no matter what. You design it to be self-healing and ephemeral, where your servers buy new ones when they detect their peers have been taken down. They get purchased from funds in the Monero wallet that customers pay into. The servers themselves are torified and don't know where they are. You can do that with SporeStack. You probably won't know how to and maybe only a thousand people in the country could pull it off, but it's doable.
>
>Or maybe you start a masternode hosting service and you configure the masternodes, but you want customers to pay for the servers themselves. You don't want to pay out of your own wallet. You can use SporeStack.
>
>Or maybe you want to spin up servers to run tests as part of your continuous integration. Or even, when you deploy code you get new servers to phase out the old ones. No upgrading, only replacement.
>
>Maybe you just want a server for a day, a month, whatever, and you don't mind that it's not the cheapest option. You feel happier knowing that a potato eating man was paid in the process of you renting a VPS.

#### Testing it out

I don't feel the need to try this one. It's legit.

#### Conclusion

I'm glad to see this project accepting BSV as one of several different currencies. It's not a BSV-specific project, though the [founder](https://go-beyond.org/post/craig-wright-is-satoshi-nakamoto/) looks like he supports it personally over other cryptocurrencies.

I also find it a little funny that given all the talk about legal compliance in BSV the chart lists a service that very clearly is trying to help at least some people skirt the law.

### 10. My movies

There's a Reddit post about My movies that says ["MyMovies - Signing a Hollywood actress with MoneyButton."](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoincashSV/comments/c7m8m4/mymovies_signing_a_hollywood_actress_with/) It links to a YouTube video but the account is [terminated.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjiiFkYSOXY)

Another Reddit post says ["The Future of Streaming Media is on the BSV Bitcoin Blockchain"](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoincashSV/comments/c5zfs1/mymovies_the_future_of_streaming_media_is_on_the/) but it links to a deleted video as well.

So far, nothing.

I finally find an [article on Coingeek](https://coingeek.com/when-craig-wright-met-the-aliens/) about it that describes it as a fan-owned movie studio that helps you distribute your films on the blockchain?

>Mymovies.us – a “decentralized development, finance, production and distribution movie studio ecosystem” or in short, “a fan-owned movie studio”.
>
>Mymovies invites people to fund, secure their rights as creators and distribute their films on the blockchain. Speaking from his home in Silicon Valley, Ted said the idea is to improve on the suggested movies which Netflix presents to its viewers by creating a strip of titles that you’d like to watch if they were made.

#### Testing it out

[MyMovies.us](https://www.mymovies.us/) is the domain! The website looks like an eartly Geocities site or something and says that it is under construction. It also gives a little more info about their backstory.

>THIS SITE IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION:
MYMOVIES.US IS THE BITCOIN ASSOCIATION HACKATHON #1 SEMIFINALIST.
WE ARE CURRENTLY DEVELOPING THE WORLD’S FIRST INTERACTIVE STREAMING MEDIA PLATFORM.
THE FUTURE OF STREAMING MEDIA IS ON THE BSV BLOCKCHAIN.

There are several movies listed as 'in-production' or 'in-development.'

- Lord Timmy and the Mystery of the Last Master

- The Image of the Beast and It Gave Life To

- The Noob: It's Fun and Games Until Someone Gets Hurt

- Night of the Chupacabbra II

- In the Arena: The Joe Kapp Story

There are more but you get the idea.

There is one film that is listed as "streaming now." It's called Mon Blanc a Vendre.

I click and it takes me to a page with a Money Button that says it is 10 cents to unlock. 

It works! A play button appears after I swipe and I can play the movie. 

#### Conclusion

I have no desire whatsoever to watch this movie. It doesn't appear to be "streaming on the blockchain" as was advertised. It's just a paywall to a play button for a movie, which is fine, but that's much less than I expected.

The website is scammy and outdated but there is indeed a movie for sale. I really don't know what to think about this? 

It is actively being worked on? What value does this add to BSV?

I don't know. I don't understand why this was listed.

### 11. BlareSV

This was an easy project to find. It appears to be by the same guy behind The BitcoinSV Channel (RIP YouTube). Here is how it is described on it's [website.](https://www.blaresv.com/)

>BLARE is an innovative, maker-centric social platform for artists and content creators to upload, publish, distribute, price, and sell their exclusive digital content (music, videos, etc.) and physical merch (CD’s, vinyl, clothing, posters, sheet music, books, etc.) at any price to their fans, being paid instantly and fairly in Bitcoin or fiat.

#### Testing it out

I can't. It releases its beta version in June 2020 according to the site.

#### Conclusion

It looks like a neat idea.

### 12. Gemscape

The recently bearded Ryan X.Charles, who I've always respected, introduced me to this when he posted the other day on [Twitter.](https://twitter.com/ryanxcharles/status/1254815371091050503?s=20)

>How can we make Money Button better? We rely on your feedback to guide our priorities. I am paying $5.00 per answer.

Gemscape describes itself like this: 

>Incentivizing feedback. Get thoughtful opinions on what matters to you.
(Or earn BitCoin instantly)

That's cool! I used to be a Quora power-user and this looks a lot better, at least in the basic idea.

#### Testing it out

I tried to use it the day I heard about it to answer Ryan's question, but it wouldn't work for me! I tried again today and was able to answer a question, which was really a survey with a series of questions.

It paid me 13 cents for my answers at the end. Easy enough.

#### Conclusion

It's real and it's a neat proof-of-concept. I didn't notice any major problems. There's some real potential if they run it well and can get good content on it. As I always say with these kinds of sites, network effects are important and a lot of early content is really bad and off-putting. 

I would probably NOT want to be in a business like this personally, but best of luck to the creators. They've definitely made something that could be useful.

### 13. Memorygame

I can't find anything on this project using Google or [Twitter queries.](https://twitter.com/search?q=memorygame%20bitcoin&src=typed_query&f=live)

I try [BSVDevs.com](https://bsvdevs.com/) and can't find it there either.

I really think it would be better to have a PDF report with LINKS to projects instead of a static image with a general name like 'Memorygame.' How am I supposed to find that?

#### Conclusion

I see no evidence this exists or ever existed.

### 14. KwabaSV

I found this easily! It's a simple web wallet. They're active on Twitter and the site is [live.](https://bico.media/b52572081e88233e6ab2ccfa5b8a44d1d969f18e10f25c3631ee4dd37703d41a#)

You can also use the service to upload files (e,g mp3, mp4, pdf's) to the METANET.

#### Conclusion

It's real and it works. It's nothing revolutionary now but it's a nice proof-of-concept.

### 15. BitcoinPong

[I already knew about this!](https://bico.media/1598502b35891e9bb6a66d115f05104b254270085740ebdd02ca36a634ef72d8) BitcoinPong, if I'm thinking of the right one, is a rudimentary pong game hosted on the BSV blockchain. That's pretty cool!

#### Testing it out

It's pong. It's self explanatory. There are five levels and I beat them easily.

#### Conclusion

It's a working proof-of-concept. I don't really know why you'd need this on a blockchain but then again I think you should be able to use the blockchain however you want.

The bigger issue is that this can hardly be considered part of the 'ecosystem' in any important way. Turn it into a real popular game with payouts for winning and other stuff and I'll reconsider.

For now, like I said, it's a proof-of-concept but hardly evidence of Bitcoin SV's progress.

### 16. Trends.Cash

[Trends.Cash](https://trends.cash/) is a tool to visualize application data like popularity on Bitcoin SV. 

#### Testing it out

I typed 'Twetch' into the search bar and it just loaded forever. I don't know if I'm doing something wrong or not, or what the purpose of the search function even is.

#### Conclusion

This is a short review because there isn't much to say. It's simple and it works except for the search function which could be my fault?

There's some interesting data on it and I can see it being more useful if BSV grows.

As with many of the projects I've reviewed so far, it feels like a proof-of-concept.

### 17. MemoSV

Memo.SV is the SV version of Memo.Cash. It's blockchain-based social media for Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV. 

#### Testing it out

I've already used it before way back in the day and it's easy enough to make Twitter-like posts. The design is subpar and the content is mostly a bit spammy. The Bitcoin Cash version is generally of higher quality people and content than the BSV one. 

In fact, among the BSV 'most active profiles,' very few have posted at all in 2020.

#### Conclusion

Censorship-resistant content is important and if blockchain is the best way to do it, let's do it!

I really liked [this bit](https://jasonc.me/blog/what-is-memo) from the creator's website.

>Memo's current functionality is just the tip of the iceberg. Soon you can have your own website forever by paying a one-time fee. No need for registering a domain, paying for servers, or keeping software up to date.

But this isn't currently a unique app to BSV and I can't see much evidence at all that many people are using it or that it has any positive impact whatsoever on the BSV ecosystem.

I don't really know why this is listed.

### 18. MetaNet TV

This is honestly getting exhausting.

MetaNet TV says in its description box: "The MetaNet is currently under construction."

What is MetaNet TV? It appears to be a YouTube/Streamanity (more on that later) channel that talks about Bitcoin SV stuff.

#### Conclusion

The last video was published 5-months ago and there doesn't appear to be much recent activity. I don't know why this was listed because it's basically just a YouTube channel that isn't very active.

### 19. FairBSV

I can't find any information that this exists or what it is supposed to be about other than the WhoIS info which says the url fairbsv.com was registered in October 2019.

### 20. Matterpool

### 21. BSV Camp

I looked up BSV Camp on Google. Their [Twitter account is dead as of this post.](https://twitter.com/bsvcamp)

Their website is also [dead.](https://www.bsvcamp.com/)

The description in the meta data says...

>Workice CRM is a web based invoicing and project management tool for freelancers and small businesses. Create and send invoices and estimates, track deals,

#### Conclusion

It's a dead project and probably never got off the ground.

### 22. RunRunRun

There's a [Medium blog](https://medium.com/@bsvrun/runrunrun-io-game-rule-2fde6d524137) that says "RUNRUNRUN.IO is the first runner lottery game base on BSV bloackchain."

Looking at their [Twitter feed,](https://twitter.com/bsvrun/status/1210457654767697921?s=20) they appear to have had some kind of working product at one point.

But the [website is not loading for me and looks dead.](runrunrun.io)

#### Conclusion

It's a dead project that had some working product at some point, but I can't really tell what.

### 23. Satoplay

### 24. Todos

I can't find any information on this at all.

### 25. Voxel SV

[3d drawing app on the BSV blockchain.](https://connor.software/bsv-voxels/)

The Github project offers a good [description.](https://github.com/connorgaskell/bsv-voxels)

>Voxel drawing application built on BitCoin SV. The position and colour data for each voxel is stored within a transaction on the BSV blockchain, as is the data for deleting a voxel at a specified position.
>
>If you want to try it out you'll need a small amount of BSV, roughly $0.01 worth will allow you to perform 20 actions. You will need to wait 1 BitCoin block, approximately 10 minutes before you can start placing voxels after funding your account. This is due to the unconfirmed transaction limit being currently set at 25, therefore the application splits your UTXO's after receiving the initial funds, this will allow you to place and remove far more voxels per BitCoin block.

### 26. Moneytrain

This is some kind of multiplayer game, but I can't get it to work. The [website](https://game.moneytrain.io/) is live but I get stuck on the create new character screen, which won't load properly.

#### Conclusion

I don't know whether it's a broken project or not. It looks like it could be a good idea.

### 27. Metaupload

This appears to have been a side project at one point. A [Twitter search](https://twitter.com/search?q=metaupload&src=typed_query&f=live) shows some comments that appear to be about it, but the original account looks like it is gone.

I have no idea what it is or was.

#### Conclusion 

It looks dead to me.

### 28. BSV Wallet Bot

This is a BSV wallet for [Telegram.](https://t.me/bsvwalletbot)

#### Conclusion

I've never seen it used but it appears to be working. It looks like the BCH and BTC tipper bots are much more active however.

### 29. SV Charts

The [SV Charts](SV Charts.com) site is a dead link. From the Google meta info on [BSVDevs.com](https://www.bsvdevs.com/index.php/detail/svcharts-com) we can tell it was, as you can imagine, going to display Bitcoin data.

>This website will show detailed charts of Bitcoin data not seen before on other websites. The number of charts at the moment is limited, but expect these to grow ...

#### Conclusion

It's another dead project.

### 30. BSV Galaxy

This was easy to find. [BSV Galaxy](https://bsvgalaxy.net/) is some kind of membership site for BSV creatives that is roughly $15 per year for access to a Telegram, Discord, and some other perks. There's also a store selling some shirts and hats.

#### Testing it out

I'm not going to pay to signup. You can see it discussed on Twitter quite recently so it's still being actively promoted and worked on.

#### Conclusion

Membership sites are popular in the world outside Bitcoin so I imagine this could be a good idea. That said, I don't know and can't find anyone who is actually a member, and the information is pretty non-specific.

Should it be listed on the chart? I have mixed feelings. It's a live site, I just don't see the value add right now or evidence this is contributing value to the BSV ecosystem. I could be wrong....

### Metahandle

The Github project says this about Metahandle:

>MetaHandle is a tool to access onchain content on Bitcoin SV (BSV). Instead of accessing it with a txid, you can reference any content to a human readable handle which is stored onchain. So all you need is to search for your handle to access any file you want.

#### Testing it out

~~I can't test it out because the linked website appears to be dead.~~

Nevermind, [it loaded after several tries.](https://www.metahandle.net/) It's actually really neat. Metahandle makes it easier to find data uploaded to the BSV blockchain. Instead of a transaction id like <code>0478a101336483d878bccec3c82bb97e8aea7f0c3c4dbf65c1ef910957b558c8</code> which is impossible to memorize, you can assign a memorable tag or bookmark to it and then search for it later.

Using the search tool, I was able to find, among other things, an [on-chain Tetris](https://bico.media/14734bc19a533ab6c510ebd419ad1e980603b1f62084b3f24b7c3d440ec6bfea) game that I played and the [first metal rock video uploaded to the chain.](https://bico.media/B://54dd9fe306fa8cdecd4e955ec5cb7332044f6b5ed8806cd500c728b53963323e)

There's also a copy of one of my favorite books, [Animal Farm.](https://bico.media/501a8cc60f9a9acbf2b0fcd4a8343ef8a525e4c72443dd3659f3803ba16aeb28)

#### Conclusion

It's a legit project that I can see being very valuable for people storing data on-chain.

### BSV Guru

[BSV Guru](https://bsv.guru/)is just some guy's blog that hasn't been updated in a couple months.

#### Conclusion

I have no idea why this is listed or why any blog would be except something on the level of, for example, CoinGeek.

### Ask The World

I can't find much information on ask the world. I originally concluded it didn't exist but hours later I discovered an article on [CoinGeek](https://coingeek.com/finalists-of-second-bitcoin-sv-virtual-hackathon-revealed/) about them that says "Ask The World provides a supply and demand economic model for seeking any kind of assistance."

Apparently they were a runner-up in a BSV hackathon in 2019.

#### Trying it out

Unfortunately I can't find anymore information or a website!

#### Conclusion

Either it doesn't exist anymore or it's not big enough currently to be relevant.

### TweeTwe

It took me forever to find this and there isn't much [info.](https://twitter.com/bitproofnetwork/status/1161472467464069120?s=20)

Unfortunately both the [TweeTwe site](https://tweetwe.bitproof.network/) and the creator's [main site](http://bitproof.network/) are down and he hasn't Tweeted since December 2019.

##### Conclusion

It used to be live but it's dead or inactive right now.

### Nicedata

This was easy to find. A Reddit post says the following:

>Two new #BSV applications coming out yesterday in China. Onchain shop(http://52freemarket.com) and onchain chatroom (http://nicedata.space) Though their products are in early stage, they will keep optimizing. Go! Chinese brilliant developers

#### Testing it out

Unfortunately the [site is dead](http://nicedata.space) and I can't try it. I don't even know what it did.

#### Conclusion

It's dead or in some kind of limbo. I don't know.

### Metanet Labs

Metanet Labs was easy to find on Google. It describes itself as a "Blockchain and Metanet education and training center." 

The site is full of cheesy stock photos but who am I to judge?

The footer of the site says that "MetaNet Labs is a sister company of MetaNet Solutions and a subsidiary company for LAYER2."

The 'About' page says that they "take pride in the fact that we are the first training organisation to deliver Metanet based training."

They list several course titles on the homepage like "The Metanet" and "Advanced—Developer."

#### Testing it out

I'd be interested in a course so I try to click the Metanet course. Unfortunately, there is no Metanet course. In fact, there are live courses on the site at all. Indeed, there appears to be no products whatsoever I can use.

#### Conclusion

It's a *bit* odd to use corporate-speak like "subsidiary company" when you don't have a product live and the site is mostly filler-content.

I can't really say this project is dead. I just can't say it's alive. I'll file it as uncertain and plan to check back in a few months.

### Metabox

### The Oracle of Bitcoin

I searched on the [BSV Open Directory,](https://dir.sv/) Reddit, Twitter, Google and BSV Devs.

I couldn't find anything.

I finally find [something](https://bico.media/1c4b58bd67a9f9f5e22b6e46e555de95de8b7f222b9230c326bde1d97dc99629) on Metahandle after I reviewed it. It tells me to ask a question on the blockchain and pay 2 cents worth of BSV and it will return an answer.

#### Testing it out

I ask "what color is the sky?" It replies "no way."

#### Conclusion

I have no idea what the point of this is or why it's listed on the chart.

#### Conclusion

I have no idea what this is and whether its alive, dead or in limbo.

### Bitcoin Forever Fund

The [Bitcoin Forever Fund](https://bsvforeverfund.com/) is a way to set up automated, scheduled payments in BSV. It's clearly a proof-of-concept right now.

#### Testing it out

I was initially skeptical. The site is very bare bones and looks dead when you visit. I can't believe they don't have any information on the homepage.

I set up an account and confirmed with my email. It worked!

The backend is simple and easy enough to use and it indeed appears to work too! You can schedule payments in advance and recurring monthly payments.

#### Conclusion

It's a real project with a solid proof-of-concept. I'm excited to see what they build.

I'm interested in how it works too and what kind of security of offers users who deposit Bitcoin SV.

### Smoove Text

[Smoove Text](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/smoove-text/id1362792811) is some kind of iPhone app listed under several BSV ecosystem roundup lists under 'Gaming and Entertainment.' It launched on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/smoove-text) a year ago as of this post.

The company [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SmooveText)account has 14 followers and has retweeted Donald Trump. It doesn't appear active.

I can't find any information on how it relates to BSV other than the Twitter location settings, which says 'metaverse', but it does have some reviews on the app store (3 stars).

>Smoove uses artificial intelligence to inspire you and your friends with motivational lessons from legends throughout history. With every tap, you are presented with a new thought. When you tap the lit icon, you can do all sorts of things with the thought including add to favorites, copy or share with friends.

#### Testing it out

I figure maybe if I download it I will figure out what it does with BSV. 

Unfortunately it keeps crashing on my phone right when I open it. I never have this problem with other apps so I assume it's the app.

#### Conclusion

I have no idea whether or not this is still being developed and how it supposedly is part of the BSV ecosystem.

It looks to be on life support.

### Bitpaste

[Bitpaste](https://www.bitpaste.app/) allows you to store immutable files and text on the Bitcoin SV blockchain with a simple swipe. Think of it like PasteBin but better.

You can also add a paywall to your uploaded content and a tip button, which they take a small fee on.

I was already familiar with it because I and many people I know use it a lot.

#### Testing it out

It works perfectly. It's exactly what a Bitcoin app should be—it works like we expect any quality app to work, only it uses Bitcoin to perform the service better. The writing experience is excellent and has all the formatting options you would expect in a writing app.

You can view my test [here.](https://www.bitpaste.app/tx/c5d6c66151092966b8a0c8af100d234f0748f1ed9f655571d1fc6686c5c11eb9)

#### Conclusion

If they're for sale, I'd like to buy them. They have a legit product that I know is useful. 

### Soundchain

I can't find any information on Soundchain. They had a Twitter account once but it has been [deleted.](https://twitter.com/soundchain_)

#### Conclusion

It's dead or in limbo. Maybe it changed its name? I don't know. 

### The BSV Daily

I assume this is or was a news site or newsletter, which I've already said probably shouldn't count on an ecosystem list in my opinion.

I wouldn't know though because I can't find any information and the one link I found is [basically dead.](https://www.agora.icu/apoteka/the-bsv-daily)

#### Conclusion

Move along. Nothing to see.

### Bitproton

[Bitproton](https://bitproton.com/) has a tool that allows you to sign cold wallet transactions offline. It also offers a web wallet.

#### Testing it out

The website was flagged by my Brave browser because it doesn't have a SSL certificate, which is a red flag. I can bypass it and the site looks well designed and professional.

The [Github](https://github.com/bitproton/coldwallet) hasn't been updated in 17 months, which doesn't necessarily mean anything.

Unfortunately I can't try the software because it is a Windows only beta.

#### Conclusion

I'm uncertain about this one. I can't see any recent activity and I don't know whether it is still actively maintained or not. Still, it doesn't look dead.

### PlayBitcoin

This appears to have been a game or something. I found a [Tweet that says:](https://twitter.com/agsupun/status/1108960744849051649?s=20)

>I even started a small game hoping to use the profits for the fund. @playbitcoin.cash

#### Testing it out

The [website is dead.](http://playbitcoin.cash/)

#### Conclusion

It's dead.

### ScrollPay

According to [CoinGeek,](https://coingeek.com/finalists-of-second-bitcoin-sv-virtual-hackathon-revealed/) ScrollPay seeks to monetize content in a way where users pay for as much as they scroll.

That sounds like a potentially neat idea. Pieter Levels made a scroll based app for his online book, Make, which scrambles text the further you scroll down the free version. You have to pay to unlock it.

What if you could unscramble text while automatically paying as you scroll? That would be COOL!

#### Testing it out

I can't find any information about testing this out and there are no website links I can find.

### Conclusion

I would have written this off as dead, but I found the person who I think created it and he's a legit developer working on some cool projects. Maybe this was a proof-of-concept or maybe he's still building it behind the scenes.

Either way, it's probably nowhere near ready to be listed on an ecosystem roundup. I hope he builds it though!

### BSV On Chain

I can't find any information on this project.

#### Conclusion

I don't know what to conclude. Question mark.

### Polynym

T[his looks like a useful tool.](https://polynym.io/)It allows you to resolve the addresses from PayMail addresses, Twetch user IDs, Handcash handles, etc.

That just means it'll convert it from one format to another.

#### Testing it out

It works! It's easy and quick. I don't have any complaints. 

#### Conclusion

It's a real service. I haven't needed a tool like this yet but if I do, I'll know where to go.

### Super Mario Bros

Someone put [Super Mario Bros on the BSV blockchain.](https://twitter.com/AttilaAros/status/1092421669673680896?s=20) That's awesome.

Doesn't this break BSV's stance on copyright though??

#### Testing it out

The link I have redirects now to another site. I wonder if there was a copyright issue? 

#### Conclusion

I love that people can do things like this. It's obviously a proof-of-concept but still, the idea of running a browser-game on Bitcoin gets me excited.

I'm disapointed I couldn't try it because it appears the link isn't working. I'm also starting to feel like little games like this should all be listed under one box on the chart. It's a bit unfair to list a bunch of games like Pong, Tetris and Super Mario Bros as separate things. It inflates the chart and makes them look like bigger 'wins' than they are.

### Sporestack

Sporestack again? It looks like this is listed twice for some reason.

### Flappy Pikachu

[Another game](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoincashSV/comments/ao43uy/play_flappy_pikachu_on_bitcoin_sv/) on the Bitcoin SV blockchain.

#### Testing it out

Once again, the [link redirects me and I can't access it.](https://www.bitcoinfiles.org/d7bac8a0e3adb2d3c2e55cb1c84a177d0269457aa7172a80297daaf5e9488cc5)

#### Conclusion

Another disappointment as I've genuinely had fun testing out these little browser games people upload. It reminds me of being a kid playing games on Addicting Games or Miniclip.

It looks to be dead unless I can find another link.

### PlayBitcoinSV

The link on BSV Devs gives me the same one as PlayBitcoin.

#### Conclusion

It looks like this was listed twice, so I have to mark it as dead twice.

### B2029

They're a Bitcoin [meetup and workshop group](https://b2029.org/about) based in Berlin.

>We're are a group of Bitcoin enthusiasts who are keen to learn more about developing on the MetaNet.
 
They seem to be quite active.
 
#### Testing it out
 
I don't have anything to test. The website is nice and I recognize several names and faces.
 
#### Conclusion
 
It's real and alive. I'm not sure a meetup group really qualifies to be on this list, but I think that's subjective.

### BSV Devs
 
I've already used [BSV Devs](https://www.bsvdevs.com/) several times in the course of doing this research.
 
BSV Devs is a BSV ecosystem aggregator focusing on software tools and applications.
 
#### Testing it out
 
It's easy to use and their search function has worked for me several times. Many of the links are outdated however and I think dead projects should be deleted eventually.

#### Conclusion

It's real, working, and useful! I just don't know why a resource list is listed on another resource chart. That seems to defeat the purpose of the chart. It's almost a bit mid-level marketing feeling,


### The White Company

According to their founder, the White Company has a suite of products like a relodable debit card, stablecoin, a Bitcoin exchange, and a marketplace that helps clients purchase luxury goods.

Maybe they can help me buy a sailboat with Bitcoin?

Their founder says in an [interview](https://coingeek.com/pay-in-bitcoin-sv-using-elizabeth-whites-reloadable-white-card-video/) that their products are all geared towards mass adoption. Instead of lengthy hashes, they use emails, etc etc.

They also offer white label solutions that help merchants accept cryptocurrency and settle in fiat or whatever they want.

#### Testing it out

First I go to their debit card signup page and there I meet my first issue. **BSV is not listed as one of the supported currencies.** I go to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thewcomp/status/1255135684135772161?s=20) and confirm they do indeed support BSV, among several other cryptocurrencies.

I'll apply for a card but it's not going to come in any reasonable time for this article.

Then I tested their online wallet. Signup is easy and the backend looks decent. Everything works!

I test their store last. It doesn't have many items listed but I think most of the work they do is directly with clients.

Still, there ar some lambos and watches, and other stuff.

My eyebrows raise though when I see 2 tickets to the 2019 Burning Man festival. It suggests they aren't doing much business if that still hasn't been updated.

#### Conclusion

It's real enough for me. They aren't BSV exclusive and don't even seem to particularly favor BSV over other cryptocurrencies. They don't advertise BSV heavily on the site and I have no indications they're going to be big players in BSV. To me it looks like BSV is just one in a basket of currencies they will support.

That's fine, but that ranks it quite a bit lower in my eyes if we're judging its relevancy to the BSV Ecosystem.

### BSV Links

Judging by the title, this *was* a BSV resource page with a bunch of links to other projects.

I wouldn't know though because the [website is dead.](https://bsvlinks.com/)

#### Conclusion

Well organised resource pages can be useful, especially if they're not dead sites.

Regardless, it makes no sense to me that this was listed on a BSV Ecosystem Chart.

### Timestamp Network

I can't find anything online about Timestamp Network.

I do find a tool called [Chronos](https://chronos.bitdb.network/) by _unwriter which timestamps transactions. Here's the use case per [CoinGeek.](http://coingeek.com/_unwriters-tools-explained-practical-use-cases-reviewed/)

>Since Chronos stores each transaction with a timestamp chronologically, this database can be used as a single source of truth in terms of keeping track of timing of transactions. Users do not have to rely on inconsistencies from other nodes, their node or miners. Therefore developers have an incentive to use Chronos for their applications rather than (god forbid) their own ‘full node’.

#### Conclusion

I have no way of knowing whether or not Chronos is Timestamp Network. I assume it's not and that this is dead or inactive.

### Duck Creation

I've bought two mugs from [Duck Creation](https://www.duckcreation.com/) before. The first one came broken but they promptly replaced it.

I didn't actually know what they did until I met one of the main guys involved in London.

They're working on a [game](https://www.duckcreation.com/demo/) powered by BSV that is not released yet. There's some kind of really basic proof-of-concept on the site but the creator told me that's pretty much nothing like the real game.

I told him to make more dug mugs in the meantime.

#### Conclusion

They're real and working on something, but I have no idea when the product will be released or what it is. In the meantime, it sort of feels like the ecosystem chart is bragging about a store that sells two mugs with drawings of cute ducks and Bitcoin.

I'm a fan of the mugs and the people involved, and I hope they build something great. But come on.

### True Reviews


### Twip

I can't find anything about Twip online. There's one reference to Twitter tipping with BAT, but nothing else, and certainly nothing associated with BSV.

#### Conclusion

Maybe I'm looking in the wrong places. Maybe it's dead. Maybe it never existed.

### Unplanaria


### Tiddalik

It's very hard to find info about Tiddalik. Here's a [Tweet.](https://twitter.com/Snugglygope/status/1191545077639741440?s=20)

It looks like it is/was a gattling gun app that maybe stress tests the BSV network?

#### Conclusion

I have no idea. If it's a stress test app, that hardly qualifies as much.

### Bitpocket

It was hard to find information on Bitpocket but I eventually found a [video](https://streamanity.com/video/3vLaKyRPwMVE1Q?ts=15883613819) from mid-2019.

The developers describe it as a task incentive system, which is fairly vague but sounds neat. They discuss it in the context of incentivizing their kids to do chores and what not, but I imagine there are a ton of other use cases.

#### Testing it out

They describe it as pre-alpha. I wasn't able to find any updates since the video but it appears the [developers are active](https://twitter.com/MetaNetTV/status/1205373171555192832?s=20) and working on it.

#### Conclusion

It's too early to tell. It's not dead, it just hasn't been born yet.

### 2048 SV

This is another [simple browser game uploaded to BSV.](https://bico.media/f2951f4f7e4e8518d98dd0aa377e2504761962fbff58d791276d6496d0827548)

#### Testing it out

I really don't know what 2048 is or how to play, but I press a bunch of buttons and the game definitely works. It's fast, well designed, etc.

#### Conclusion

It's real. I don't know if it's being actively worked on though. It seems kind of like a 'done-and-upload' project. As with most of the games, I don't really think these should seriously count as multiple listings on the chart.

### Bitproof

Bitproof has something to do with turning data into PDFs, but I can't really find any information on it.

#### Testing it out

The [website is dead.](https://pdf.bitproof.network/)

#### Conclusion

It looks like a dead project to me!

### Cryptograffiti

I found this [project very easily.](https://cryptograffiti.info/) It's a tool for viewing text or file data on the blockchain that used to be for Bitcoin Cash but switched over to Bitcoin SV

>CryptoGraffiti.info monitors the Bitcoin network in real-time and tries to detect transactions that contain either human-readable text messages or files of known formats. When it finds such a transaction, it will be published under the READ tab. Our decoder is capable of finding even those messages that originate from third parties (such as twetch.app).

You can also encode your own messages and timestamp files with a cryptographic hash that is shared on the blockchain without actually uploading the file.

>Unlike with Null Data (OP_RETURN), which the miners could trivially delete from their storage, we make the data look like someone's unspent bitcoins. Any data that is saved in this manner becomes truly immutable. That said, it is advisable to use this service responsibly because only perhaps with an international court order can such data be erased.

#### Testing it out

I remember Andreas Brekken [shared a message last year.](https://cryptograffiti.info/#406c18ff8e210c0fb210763a786db9b25ff6ccd3807d76721891d80adb7b6dcc) It says "Epstein Didn't Kill Himself."

Here's another [message](https://cryptograffiti.info/#664b6224939f47bc8e07a0497b97a3c418987df9f9e85a83ac0c6ebb9c15a4a8) I found on the Read discovery tool. It says "Anyone who still thinks Craig Wright isn't Satoshi Nakamoto in 2020 is a moron."

#### Conclusion

It's a real tool. It's kind of cool to be able to immutably store and view messages like this.

### Social Gambling

I can't find any information on 'Social Gambling.' It looks to me like it could be a double listing for [Phun.io,](https://www.phun.io/) which is described as the "Social Bitcoin SV Gambling Game," which I will review later.

#### Conclusion

It's probably a double listing, but I can't know for sure. I definitely can't find any info that it exists.

### SatoshiMaps

[SatoshiMaps](https://www.satoshimaps.com/) is on-chain BSV maps.

>Users are invited to add business listings to the map. All content is stored on-chain, and ultimately, can be overlayed on any map software, wether Google Maps or some open source GIS software.
>
>We attempt to utilise the concept of an economic community to build a registry of businesses all over the world. Primarily, we are interested in businesses that accept Bitcoin. But all businesses can be included, we will simply build tools to filter for such specifics over time.

You can also upvote or downvote listings with a microtransaction to make sure listings are accurate.

>The concept of the 'economic community' involves users paying a microtransaction to make a listing, and paying a microtransaction to downvote an invalid or inaccurate listing. This serves to keep the information as honest as possible. Further it provides excellent incentive for miners to keep mining. The more apps we can build that work off micro txs the better.

#### Testing it out

It's easy to post a listing, though it doesn't feel like the marker on the map will be terribly accurate unless you already know the longitude and latitude.

Viewing a listing is easy too, but I can imagine the map getting very clogged up quickly once more data is there.

#### Conclusion

It's really a proof-of-concept. I can't see it being particlarly useful to anyone now but it's a real, working test which is cool. For now, just use Apple Maps.

### CodeOnChain

[CodeOnChain](https://codeonchain.network/) helps you upload full code repositories to the BSV blockchain.

I was inititally skeptical but several people I know have used it, and apparently an Iranian developer who had his GitHub account restricted because of [US trade regulations](https://codeonchain.network/tx/84050ec6fad94fc635da3b49b883a701348ee1c03e5f874a9858a5657475577c) was able to [use it.](https://twitter.com/ronaldo_hommel/status/1185891352556400641?s=20)

#### Testing it out

I set up a [repository](https://codeonchain.network/tx/6a5ca5ecc601e1486e78d20cbbc2ec21c712f34b03a3d279e678840b8aa6f1ad) for less than 1 cent! It appears to have all the functionality I'd be looking for.

Unfortunately I forgot to save my master key so I can't edit it or add more files! But this is user error for sure.

#### Conclusion

This is a legit project that allows anyone, anywhere to set up a censorship-resistant git repository with full version control. I love that.

It's definitely in an early version but I hope they keep developing it.
