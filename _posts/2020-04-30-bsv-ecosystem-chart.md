title: Investigating the BSV Ecosystem Chart
permalink: bsv-ecosystem-chart
---

The BSV Ecosystem Chart as of April 30, 2020 records 414 total projects developed at a rate of .8 projects per day.

I've seen this chart shared regularly for months as evidence of all the innovation and development happening in BSV, but I've never seriously taken a look at the projects it lists. This article reviews all the projects and attempts to assess the accuracy of the report.

### BSV Kanban

It took me a long time to find BSV Kanban. Search queries on Twitter for ['BSV Kanban'](https://twitter.com/search?q=bsv%20kanban&src=typed_query&f=live) and ['Bitcoin SV Kanban'](https://twitter.com/search?q=bitcoin%20sv%20kanban&src=typed_query&f=live) don't return anything useful.

I tracked it down on [Github](https://github.com/armedi/bsv-kanban). It hasn't been updated in 4-months and the README says "I made this app to learn how to store data to bsv using moneybutton."

I can't find anything else about this project and can't draw any other conclusions than that it is an inactive learning project. 

### Fullcycle

Several Twitter queries don't show anything. A [dead forum link](http://forum.maars.com/viewtopic.php?t=15) I find on Google gives me some clue that it's related to mining, from Google meta data.

I find it on [Github](https://github.com/dfoderick/fullcycle) as well.

>Full Cycle Mining Controller - a workflow message bus microservice architecture for bitcoin mining

The README says it is a monitoring and management system for Bitcoin mining that tracks or does things like "temperature and hash rate of ASIC miners,' 'automatically configure miners with your pool worker accounts,' 'discover new miners on the network,' etc.

![Fullcycle](https://github.com/dfoderick/fullcycle/raw/master/images/FullCycleReact.png?raw=true)

It's been 2 years since the last Github commit, which is not necessarily a relevant metric, but I can't find any other information about who is using this project or whether or not it is active.

### Wikisv

~~This is easy because I was at CoinGeek London [thanks to the generosity of Calvin and the help of Ed, and team] when this was announced. ~~

I was wrong as the chart lists BitcoinWiki as well, which is the project I was thinking of. We will cover that later.

One user on [Twitter writes:](https://twitter.com/veganbeefcake/status/1204742328021331969?s=20) "I would happily donate a substantial amount of BSV towards a WikiSV as you described." 

Other than that, I cannot find any information on Wikisv. That doesn't mean it doesn't exist, but I don't know where else to look.

### Tocial Chat

Tocial is a Chinese app described as the ['Most Popular Blockchain AGC Photo Social Platform.'](https://tocial.io/) There is not much info on the website and the app links take me to the Apple TestFlight service for beta testers.

It surprises me a service that is in beta would describe itself as 'the most popular' of anything, even if it's in its own category entirely.

I really don't want to download. Is it malware? Will it screw up my phone? Probably not since Apple vets it first, right? Still, I'm worried but I need to be thorough...And at least their [Twitter account is active.](https://twitter.com/tocial_chat)

#### Testing Tocial

I downloaded the app and was prompted to create an account and add some basic personal information. Doing that was easy enough.

When I log in, I see most of the posts made are in Chinese, which isn't surpising. I see @vegard, who is someone I recognize from BSV Twitter has posted a photo of himself. I also see Eli Afram, whom I recognize as well.

The 'Timeline' feature shows a rolling feed of posts that seem to be similar to Instagram's "Discover" feed. There's at least usually a post every day, but seldom many in one day. I don't know if this displays ALL possible posts or just a selection.

Most of the content ranges from, to be blunt, very sexy Asian women to gross BSDM type stuff. There's also a post that says Craig is Satoshi.

#### What I like

Tocial has a neat feature that allows users to upload several photos in a series like Instagram but selectively paywall them with BSV. Users can pay a micropayment, or whatever price set by the owner, to access them instantly.

The paywall seems to mostly be used now for more explicit imagery, but I can imagine something like this being really neat in the future for all types of content creators, not just attractive Asian women.

The app works pretty well. Things load a bit slow as is expected with new apps but the interface is easy enough to follow and I didn't notice anything breaking.

#### What I don't like

It will have a long way to go to gain traction. Sometimes I think it would make more sense to get an existing service to integrate Bitcoin than to replicate one with Bitcoin functionality. The network effects of entrenched social platforms are hard to overcome.

The content is also subpar at best. The women are attractive but I can't imagine spending my days scrolling through the feed for that, and there's really nothing else that's even remotely worth viewing right now.

#### Conclusion

It's a real project. It has a lot of work to do but there's actually some potential here.

### 9k nodes

Once again, it took me a while to find information on this project. According to a video on [The Bitcoin Assocation YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/3Orxl1rKx8Y?t=250), it's a 2d block explorer that shows information in a graph format.

The project looks like it was developed as part of a Hackathon.

#### Testing it out

It works! And it's actually cool. I can see something like this being more useful than regular block explorers. The way it shows relationships between different data is much more user friendly.

#### What I don't like

I can't find any information on whether or not this is still being developed or any info on the founders. It's also a bit slow and clunky when you open too many data points at once, which is frustrating.

#### Conclusion

It's a neat proof-of-concept. I wish I could find more information. 

#### Zakat Network

Zakat is an annual obligatory charitable payment for Muslims, as I understand it. Is this some kind of way to allow Muslims to pay this with Bitcoin SV?

I wouldn't know because I can't find ANY information.

#### BitcastSV

I already know about BitcastSV because their Twitter account has liked some things I've posted recently. According to their Twitter description:

> The BitCastSV podcast is dedicated to the one and only Bitcoin as described in the Satoshi whitepaper. 

They launched three months ago and have recorded [two episodes on their YouTube channel.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiwOHm0LnbNO1WdU6wxbPVA)

I guess I've got to listen to an episode...

#### Conclusion
