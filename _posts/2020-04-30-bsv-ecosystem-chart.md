The BSV Ecosystem Chart as of April 30, 2020 records 414 total projects developed at a rate of .8 projects per day.

I've seen this chart shared regularly for months as evidence of all the innovation and development happening in BSV, but I've never seriously taken a look at the projects it lists. This article reviews all the projects and attempts to assess the accuracy of the report.
