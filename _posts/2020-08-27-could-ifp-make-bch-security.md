title:  Could the Infastructure Funding Plan Make Bitcoin Cash (BCH) a Security?

When I lived in NYC, a friend would always go to a certain Equinox that had a sauna, cold plunge, hot tub, and steam room on Friday evenings. It was an easy way for us to regularly meet up since we lived in different parts of the city, and it was a great social event to invite other friends to. 

If you can have a few of these standing events each week, and organize a few other open invite style events around them, you can very quickly fill up your week with social activities that are more interesting than going to happy hour. 

Which ties into the last piece of replacing happy hour: planning to plan things.
