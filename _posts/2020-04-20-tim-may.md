## Bitcoin 

"I can’t speak for what Satoshi intended, but I sure don’t think it involved bitcoin exchanges that have draconian rules about KYC, AML, passports, freezes on accounts and laws about reporting “suspicious activity” to the local secret police. There’s a real possibility that all the noise about “governance,” “regulation” and “blockchain” will effectively create a surveillance state, a dossier society."

"The excitement about bitcoin was mostly about bypassing controls, to enable exotic new uses like Silk Road. It was some cool and edgy stuff, not just another PayPal." [Enough with the ICO-Me-So-Horny-Get-Rich-Quick-Lambo Crypto](https://www.coindesk.com/enough-with-the-ico-me-so-horny-get-rich-quick-lambo-crypto)

"Sending bitcoin...is equivalent to “saying” a number. To ban saying a number is equivalent to a ban on some speech." [Enough with the ICO-Me-So-Horny-Get-Rich-Quick-Lambo Crypto](https://www.coindesk.com/enough-with-the-ico-me-so-horny-get-rich-quick-lambo-crypto)

"The people I hear about who are reportedly transferring “interesting” amounts of money are using basic forms of bitcoin or bitcoin cash, not exotics new things like Lightning, Avalanche, or the 30 to 100 other things."

"I still think cryptocurrency is too complicated…coins, forks, sharding, off-chain networks, DAGs, proof-of-work vs. proof-of-stake, the average person cannot plausibly follow all of this. What use cases, really? There’s talk about the eventual replacement of the banking system, or credit cards, PayPal, etc. is nice, but what does it do NOW?

The most compelling cases I hear about are when someone transfers money to a party that has been blocked by PayPal, Visa (etc), or banks and wire transfers. The rest is hype, evangelizing, HODL, get-rich lambo garbage."
